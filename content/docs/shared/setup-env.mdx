Before starting the tutorials, you must prepare your development environment by installing a number of tools. This topic covers the setup required for the tutorials.

You can also watch a video about installing the smart contract tools.

First, you need to install `rustup` which installs Rust and Cargo to your computer. Go to [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install `rustup` for your platform.

Type **1** to continue the installation.

<Callout

Currently, Rust toolchain versions up to `1.81` are and newer are not supported by older `cargo-concordium` versions ( \<= `4.0.0`). Update `cargo-concordium` if you see the error `Unexpected byte 0x80. Expected 0x00` as follows:

```console
$ cargo install cargo-concordium
$ cargo concordium --version
$ cargo-concordium 4.1.1
```

The minimum supported rust version is currently version `1.73`

Copy and paste the commands in a terminal to install Wasm which will be used for building contracts.

```console
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

During Wasm installation in your system you should see something similar to below.

![](/../images/mint-wasm-install.png)console
$cargo install --locked cargo-concordium
```

For a description of how to use the `cargo-concordium` run:

```console
$cargo concordium --help
```

To use verifiable builds with cargo-concordium a container runtime such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required.

(interact-with-your-contract)=

## Download and run Concordium Client

The `concordium-client` tool allows you to interact with a Concordium node. The tutorials use `concordium-client` as a command line tool to deploy, mint, and transfer. The tools is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. [Download it for your operating system here](#concordium-node-and-client-download-testnet). You find documentation of important commands that the `concordium-client` tool provides [here](#concordium-client).

Rename the package to `concordium-client` in case it has some version annotation. Go to the folder where you downloaded the `concordium-client`. You can check if you are in the correct folder when you see the output `concordium-client` from the command:

```console
$ls | grep 'concordium-client'
```

![](/../images/pb_tutorial_10.png)console
$chmod +x concordium-client
```

![](/../images/pb_tutorial_8.png)console
$./concordium-client --help
```

You should see some output that will help you in getting familiar with the `concordium-client` tool.

(testnet-faucet)=

Use the Testnet faucet in your account to claim 2000 CCDs for testing purposes:

Click the **Activity** button on the main screen, and then click **Request CCD**.

![](/../images/request-CCD.png){raw} html
<div style="margin-bottom: 50px;"></div>
```

One thing to note is that if you click the **Send** button on the main screen, you go to the Send funds screen where you can transfer CCDs. You can type the amount of CCD and the recipient’s address in this section. As you can see below, the screen shows the *Estimated transaction fee* in CCD terms. This allows you to estimate the costs beforehand and helps you to calculate your business expenses.

<div style="margin-bottom: 50px;"></div>
```

After that, you need to [export the keys](#export-key) for your account. Save the file on your local machine in the same folder as the rest of the repository. It will have a name like this \<YOUR PUBLIC ADDRESS>.export. You can open it with a text editor and see your signKey, verifyKey in there. Copy signKey and your address. You will use them while deploying and interacting with your contract.

To export the key, go to the Accounts page and click **Export** next to *Private key*. Enter your passcode and click **Show private key**, and then **Export**.

![](/../images/export-key-new.png){raw} html
<div style="margin-bottom: 50px;"></div>
```

When you export the key, it creates a file named `<YOUR PUBLIC ADDRESS>.export`. Open it with a text editor and find your `signKey`, `verifyKey` in there. Copy the `signKey` and your address. You will use it while deploying and interacting with your contract.

![](/../images/bw-exported-key.png)console
concordium-client config account import <Wallet.export> --name <Your-Wallet-Name>
```
