(setup-env)=


Before starting the tutorials, you must prepare your development environment by installing a number of tools. This topic covers the setup required for the tutorials.

<Callout

You can also watch a video about installing the smart contract tools.

First, you need to install `rustup` which installs Rust and Cargo to your computer. Go to [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install `rustup` for your platform.

Type **1** to continue the installation.

<Callout
  body={<>
Currently, Rust toolchain versions up to `1.81` are and newer are not supported by older `cargo-concordium` versions ( \<= `4.0.0`). Update `cargo-concordium` if you see the error `Unexpected byte 0x80. Expected 0x00` as follows:

```console
$ cargo install cargo-concordium
$ cargo concordium --version
$ cargo-concordium 4.1.1
```

The minimum supported rust version is currently version `1.73`

Copy and paste the commands in a terminal to install Wasm which will be used for building contracts.

```console
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

During Wasm installation in your system you should see something similar to below.

![](/images/mint-wasm-install.png)console
$cargo install --locked cargo-concordium
```

For a description of how to use the `cargo-concordium` run:

```console
$cargo concordium --help
```

To use verifiable builds with cargo-concordium a container runtime such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required.

(interact-with-your-contract)=

## Download and run Concordium Client

The `concordium-client` tool allows you to interact with a Concordium node. The tutorials use `concordium-client` as a command line tool to deploy, mint, and transfer. The tools is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. [Download it for your operating system here](/docs/mainnet/docs/installation/downloads#concordium-node-and-client-download-testnet). You find documentation of important commands that the `concordium-client` tool provides [here](/docs/mainnet/tools/concordium-client#concordium-client).

Rename the package to `concordium-client` in case it has some version annotation. Go to the folder where you downloaded the `concordium-client`. You can check if you are in the correct folder when you see the output `concordium-client` from the command:

```console
$ls | grep 'concordium-client'
```

![](/images/pb_tutorial_10.png)console
$chmod +x concordium-client
```

![](/images/pb_tutorial_8.png)console
$./concordium-client --help
```

You should see some output that will help you in getting familiar with the `concordium-client` tool.

![](/images/pb_tutorial_9.png)console

$chmod +x concordium-client

```
Check if everything is connected correctly by displaying the best/latest block.

```console

$./concordium-client block show --grpc-port 20001

```
You should see some block data output.

<accordion

  docText={<>
This option explains how you can use the ``concordium-client`` tool locally on your machine and connect remotely to your node running on the server.

**Advantage**: You don't have to transfer files between your local machine and your instance later in the tutorial.

**Disadvantage**: You have to use ssh with port forwarding when you run a command locally.

Since you have a remote server your cloud provider usually gives you an option to ssh into it. Add the following port forwarding rule to your method to ssh into your instance in terminal A. The port 20001 on your localhost is forwarded to the port 20001 on your instance.

```console

$ssh -NL localhost:20001:<IP-address-of-your-instance>:20001 <username>@<host>

```
![](/images/pb_tutorial_26.png)
<Callout
  body={<>
Port 20001 is open by default on your testnet node to interact with it. Cloud providers often use ``ubuntu`` as the default <username> and the <IP-address-of-your-instance> as the default <host>.
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>
Go in another terminal B to the folder where you downloaded the ``concordium-client``. Check if everything is connected correctly by displaying the best/latest block.

```console

$./concordium-client block show --grpc-port 20001

```
You should see some block data output.

## Concordium node on Testnet

For the purposes of these tutorials and for testing, a node is available on testnet to use when testing smart contracts and dApps so you do not need to run your own node. You can use this node for API calls of chain methods only with gRPC v2 and gRPC web. The address is `grpc.testnet.concordium.com` on port 20000 (gRPCv2 and gRPC-web). You can use this node for API calls of *chain methods only*. This node is maintained by Concordium, but Concordium does not guarantee availability. The status of this node is available on the [Testnet status page](https://status.testnet.concordium.software).

If you wish to run your own node, see [Run a node on Concordium](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/node-requirements#node-requirements).

(setup-wallet)=

## Set up a wallet

Now you need a Concordium wallet. Use the Concordium Wallet for Web. The Concordium Wallet for Web uses a 24 word secret recovery phrase to secure your wallet. Make sure to protect your 24 word secret recovery phrase and store it in a secure place. Anyone who knows the secret recovery phrase can access your wallet.

Use [this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/concordium-wallet/mnnkpffndmickbiakofclnpoiajlegmg?hl=en-US) to install a Concordium Wallet for Web in a chromium web browser. Follow [these instructions](/docs/mainnet/docs/browser-wallet/setup-browser-wallet#setup-bw) to install the extension. Configure it to run on testnet with an identity created from the Concordium testnet IP (shown below) and an account based on that identity. You don't have to provide an ID to create an identity on testnet when selecting `Concordium testnet IP`. Test identities are meant for testnet testing only.

(testnet-faucet)=

Use the Testnet faucet in your account to claim 2000 CCDs for testing purposes:

Click the **Activity** button on the main screen, and then click **Request CCD**.

![](/images/request-CCD.png){raw} html
<div style="margin-bottom: 50px;"></div>
```

One thing to note is that if you click the **Send** button on the main screen, you go to the Send funds screen where you can transfer CCDs. You can type the amount of CCD and the recipient’s address in this section. As you can see below, the screen shows the *Estimated transaction fee* in CCD terms. This allows you to estimate the costs beforehand and helps you to calculate your business expenses.

![](/images/send-funds.png){raw} html
<div style="margin-bottom: 50px;"></div>
```

After that, you need to [export the keys](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/export-account-private-key#export-key) for your account. Save the file on your local machine in the same folder as the rest of the repository. It will have a name like this \<YOUR PUBLIC ADDRESS>.export. You can open it with a text editor and see your signKey, verifyKey in there. Copy signKey and your address. You will use them while deploying and interacting with your contract.

To export the key, go to the Accounts page and click **Export** next to *Private key*. Enter your passcode and click **Show private key**, and then **Export**.

![](/images/export-key-new.png){raw} html
<div style="margin-bottom: 50px;"></div>
```

When you export the key, it creates a file named `<YOUR PUBLIC ADDRESS>.export`. Open it with a text editor and find your `signKey`, `verifyKey` in there. Copy the `signKey` and your address. You will use it while deploying and interacting with your contract.

![](/images/bw-exported-key.png)console
concordium-client config account import <Wallet.export> --name <Your-Wallet-Name>
```
