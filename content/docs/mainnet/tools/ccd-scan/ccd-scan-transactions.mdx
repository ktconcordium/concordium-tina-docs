- **Events/Reject reason**: list of events included in the transaction. It contains more details about the transaction, including drill-through links and copy options where available. There are many different transaction types and descriptions.

A successful transaction shows the **Events** that were the result of the transaction.

If the transaction was rejected, you see something similar to the following:

The only effect of a rejected transaction is the payment for execution cost. In contrast, a successful transaction affects the state of the chain. The effects are described by the generated events.
