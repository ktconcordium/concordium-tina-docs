title: "Wallet SDK"

(wallet-sdk)=


This integration guide is directed towards developers who want to implement their own wallet for the Concordium blockchain.
This typically means either a mobile wallet (iOS or Android), or a solution building on TypeScript or JavaScript.

The SDK provides the necessary functions to derive the correct Concordium keys from a secret recovery phrase, to
generate the Concordium specific requests to create and recover identities, to create and deploy a credential, and
to create and send transactions to a Concordium node.

Below, you can find a link to the SDK package for your chosen technology, and an example wallet that demonstrates its usage.
