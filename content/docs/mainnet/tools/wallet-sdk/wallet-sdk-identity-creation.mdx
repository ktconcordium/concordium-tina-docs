(wallet-sdk-identity-creation)=


To create an account on the Concordium blockchain, a user must first acquire an identity. Therefore, as an initial step, a wallet user will always have to create an identity before being able to send account transactions.

An identity is acquired by generating an identity request and sending it to an identity provider. The user will then be taken through the identity verification
process that is specific for that chosen identity provider. This happens outside of the wallet application.

- [Send an identity request]
- [Retrieve the identity after creation]

## Create an identity request

The first step is to create the actual identity request. To do this, you need the list of identity providers. Refer to [Identity Provider List](#Identity Provider List) to understand how to retrieve it.

## Send an identity request

Once the identity request has been created, the next step is to send it to the corresponding identity provider. There are multiple ways to accomplish this, and it will depend on the technologies you choose. Below is an example of how it can be done.

A part of the request is a `redirectUri`, which tells the identity provider where to redirect the user when the identity verification flow has been completed. A wallet application has to choose this in such a way that the user is sent back into the wallet application, where the actual identity object can then be retrieved from the information provided in the hash property of the redirect URL.

## Retrieve the identity after creation

Upon completing identity verification with the identity provider, the identity provider does a redirect of the user back to the `redirectUri` that was provided when sending the identity request to the identity provider. The hash property of the URL that the identity provider redirects the user to contains the URL where the identity object can be retrieved from in the format `redirectUri#code_uri=`, where the URL will be after the equals sign.
