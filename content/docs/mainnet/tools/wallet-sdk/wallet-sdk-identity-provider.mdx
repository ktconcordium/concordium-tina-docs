(wallet-sdk-identity-provider)=


The list of identity providers can be retrieved from a Concordium node; however, the provided list lacks the necessary metadata for creating or recovering an identity from an identity provider. Therefore, Concordium hosts a service called the wallet-proxy that serves this information to wallets.
