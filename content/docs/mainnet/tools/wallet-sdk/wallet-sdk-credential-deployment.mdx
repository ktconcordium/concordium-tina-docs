Having created an identity, the next step is to create an account. On Concordium, an account is an entity that can hold multiple credentials, but for the sake of keeping the example simple, the following guide will describe how to create an account with a single credential.

- [Create a credential deployment transaction]
- [Sign a credential deployment transaction]
- [Send a credential deployment transaction]

## Create a credential deployment transaction

The following example demonstrates how a credential deployment transaction is created. Note that you must have saved the identity object and the identity provider that was used to create that identity, as they are required input for this transaction type.

## Sign a credential deployment transaction

With the credential deployment transaction created, the next step is to sign the transaction. It is important that the key used for signing the transaction
is the signing key that corresponds to the public key used when creating the transaction. If they do not match, then the transaction will be rejected.

## Send a credential deployment transaction

Having created and signed the credential deployment transaction, the final step is to send it to a Concordium node. The SDKs provide a
utility function that does this by simply providing it the credential deployment transaction and the signature on the transaction. The result
of the call is a transaction hash that can then be used to monitor the status of the transaction.

If successful, the credential will be deployed, and it is now possible to start creating account transactions. Go to
[wallet-sdk-account-transaction](/docs/mainnet/tools/wallet-sdk/wallet-sdk-account-transaction#wallet-sdk-account-transaction) for a guide about creating account transactions.
