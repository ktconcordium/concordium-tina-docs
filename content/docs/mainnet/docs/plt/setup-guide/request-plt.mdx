This guide explains how to request the issuance of a custom Protocol-Level Token (PLT) on testnet for testing and development purposes. Please read the [CIS-7 standard](https://proposals.concordium.com/CIS/cis-7.html#cis-7-protocol-level-tokens-plts) for PLTs to understand the token parameters and metadata requirements before submitting your request.

(plt-overview)=

## Overview

Creating a new PLT is a chain-governance operation performed by the Concordium team through a chain creation update. The process involves defining token parameters and creating metadata to create the PLT on the network.

Once created, the PLT information is stored on-chain, including any initial supply that gets minted. After creation, token-governance operations and token-holder operations can be invoked for the new token type.

(plt-metadata)=

## PLT metadata

To provide visual assets like token thumbnails and images, create a metadata JSON file and host it off-chain. You can read more about the **metadata URL** parameter in [this section](https://proposals.concordium.com/CIS/cis-7.html#metadata-url) of the CIS-7 standard, and about the metadata format in [this chapter](https://proposals.concordium.com/CIS/cis-7.html#token-metadata-format) of the standard.

An option is to upload it to IPFS or another public storage online. For a tutorial on how to use IPFS by running a node, read [this article](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/nft-minting/upload-nft#upload-nft). Alternatively, you can use a pinning solution such as <https://pinata.cloud/> or any other decentralized storage systems. The URL of the metadata file will be added to the PLT definition.

## Request process

Follow these steps to request PLT issuance:

1. **Prepare your token metadata**

   Create and host your metadata JSON file following the format above.

2. **Fill out the form below** (or use [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjTvpdAYeWO9VEYitaXR46Fb5flT70zi5U88dVsjLIKWAKXA/viewform?usp=dialog) to fill out the PLT initialization application form)

```{raw} html
<iframe
  id="plt-form"
  src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjTvpdAYeWO9VEYitaXR46Fb5flT70zi5U88dVsjLIKWAKXA/viewform?embedded=true"
  width="100%"
  height="1500"
  frameborder="0"
  marginheight="0"
  marginwidth="0"
  title="PLT issuance request form">
</iframe>

<script>
  const iframe = document.getElementById('plt-form');
  iframe.onload = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      iframe.style.height = iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px';
    }, 1000);
  };
</script>
```

3. **Submit your request**

   Click Submit to send your PLT issuance request with all the token parameters to the Concordium team.

## Token definition properties

For a detailed explanation of the parameters, please read the [CIS-7: Protocol-level Tokens (PLTs) Standard](https://proposals.concordium.com/CIS/cis-7.html#common-types). Your PLT will be created with the following parameters:

<!-- dropped unknown eval-rst block -->

## What happens next

- Tokens will be issued manually by the Concordium team
- The tokens will be issued directly to your nominated account address

You are now ready to start using your custom PLT for testing on testnet. Learn about the available operations in [PLT Operations](/docs/mainnet/docs/plt/operations/index#plt-operations).
