(plt-account-creation)=


This guide explains how to create an [account](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#account) on DevNet using your existing identity. You'll need this account to perform transactions and work with Protocol-Level Tokens.

Once you have [created your identity](/docs/mainnet/docs/plt/setup-guide/identity-creation#plt-identity-creation), follow these steps to create an account:

1. In the wallet, go to **Accounts**

   ![select accounts in menu](/../Images/create-account1.png)

![start creating new account](/../Images/create-account2.png)

3. Select your new identity that you just created

![finish creating new account](/../Images/create-account4.png)

After completing these steps, you are now connected to DevNet with a working account.
