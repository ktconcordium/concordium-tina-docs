This guide explains how to download and install the custom DevNet Browser Wallet, which is required for connecting to Concordium's DevNet environment and working with Protocol-Level Tokens (PLTs).

## About the DevNet Browser Wallet

The DevNet Browser Wallet is a special edition of the Concordium Browser Wallet that supports connections to custom networks, including DevNet. This version is required as the standard Browser Wallet only connects to [Mainnet](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#mainnet) and [Testnet](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#testnet).

## Download and installation

Follow these steps to install the custom DevNet Browser Wallet:

1. **Download the DevNet Browser Wallet**

   Download [Browser Wallet v2.2.14](https://distribution.concordium.software/devnet/concordium-browser-wallet-2.2.14.zip), the custom version that allows connection to DevNet.

   :::{note}
   This feature will be incorporated into the standard Browser Wallet in future versions, but currently requires this special edition.
