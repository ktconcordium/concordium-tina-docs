(overview-shared-accounts)=


In the Desktop Wallet, you have the option of creating shared accounts, also known as multi-signature accounts. This is useful, for example, if your organization wants to allow multiple people to manage an account, or if you’re part of a group of people who want to share an account. In these cases, more credentials must be added to an account.

## Credentials

It’s the credentials on an account that determine who’s allowed to sign transactions. An account credential holds signature verification keys, information related to the [Privacy Guardians](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#privacy-guardian-pg), and the public [attributes](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#attributes) of the account owner. The credential proves that the account owner has been verified by an [identity provider](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#identity-provider), but it doesn’t identify the account owner to the identity provider. However, in the case of a valid request from a government authority via established legal channels, it allows the Privacy Guardians and the identity provider, when they work together, to link the account to the users. For more information, see [Identity framework on Concordium](/docs/mainnet/docs/protocol/identity#reference-identity).

## Signature threshold

Once you’ve added more credentials on an account, you can also specify the number of signatures that are needed to sign a transaction. This is the signature threshold. For example, three users can have a shared account where two of them are needed to authorize a transaction, or three users can have a shared account where only one of them is needed to authorize a transaction.

## Share accounts

The following is an overview of the tasks that are needed to add more credentials to an account with links to more information about each task.

### Step 1

A user creates the account that's going to be used as a shared account.
See [Create an account in the Desktop Wallet](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/create-account#create-account).

### Step 2

The account owner shares the account address with the user or users whose credentials are going to be added to the account.

### Step 3

The users whose credentials are going to be added to the shared account generates a file with credentials that are associated with the account. The user sends the file to the initial account owner. See [Create a credentials file](/docs/mainnet/docs/desktop-wallet/create-credentials-file#create-credentials-file)

### Step 4

The initial account owner imports the file and adds the credentials to the account. If needed, the user changes the signature threshold. See [Add credentials to an account](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/multi-credentials#multi-credentials).
