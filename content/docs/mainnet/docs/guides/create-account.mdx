(create-account)=


Desktop Wallet users: When you created your [identity](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#identity), it came with an [initial account](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#initial-account). The initial account is a special account that the [identity provider](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#identity-provider) submits
to the chain. When you already have an identity, you can create more [accounts](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#account) with that identity yourself.

Concordium Wallet for Web and Concordium Wallet users: No initial account was created when you created your [identity](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#identity). You create all [accounts](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#account) related to your identities.

To learn more about identities and accounts, see [Identity framework on Concordium](/docs/mainnet/docs/protocol/identity#reference-identity) and [Accounts](/docs/mainnet/docs/protocol/manage-accounts#managing_accounts).
