title: "Create an identity"

(create-initial-account)=


Before you can start using a Wallet and submit transactions to the blockchain, you need an identity issued by an identity provider.

For Desktop Wallet, the identity provider also issues an initial account and submits it to the chain. The identity provider knows the identity of the owner of this initial account, but not of any other accounts that you create.

For Concordium Wallet for Web and Concordium Wallet, an initial account is not submitted by the identity provider.

To learn more about identities and accounts, see [Identitity](/docs/mainnet/docs/protocol/identity#reference-identity) and [Accounts](/docs/mainnet/docs/protocol/manage-accounts#managing_accounts).

If using Concordium Wallet for Web or Concordium Wallet with Digitial Trust Solutions (DTS) as your identity provider, and you have a mitID (Denmark) or Suomi.fi e-identification (Finland), you can use that to complete the identity verification process.

You can submit requests for additional [identities](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#identity) in the Concordium Wallet. You do this from the **Identities** screen.

1. Open *Wallet Settings* by tapping the gear icon in the lower right of the main screen.

2. Tap **Identities**.

3. On the Identities screen, tap the **+** in the upper right corner.

4. Select a third-party identity provider from the list. An external web page opens within the app.

5. Enter the information requested by the third-party identity provider. The information might vary depending on the identity provider. However, they will ask you to provide photos of identification documents and a selfie.

6. When you have submitted the information to the identity provider, you will have a pending identity in your app. The verification or rejection is usually retrieved from the identity provider within minutes, but check your app frequently to retrieve the result. It might take up to seven days for the result to appear.


You can edit the identity name after it has been created so that it is more descriptive in your wallet. This does not change anything with the identity provider or on chain. For more information, see [Change identity name](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/change-identity-name#change-mw-id-name).

   - Create credential (each credential is assigned a number): : Press the right button and then both buttons to confirm **Accept**.
