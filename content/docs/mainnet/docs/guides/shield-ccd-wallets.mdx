Functionalities related to shielding a balance are deprecated in protocol 7 and above.
No additional shielded balance can be added to an account and no transfer of shielded balance is possible.
Only unshielding of an already shielded balance is possible and recommended to be done.
Wallets and command-line tools will continue to display shielded balances and support the
unshielding flow to recover already shielded funds.

The next few paragraphs contain some old context regarding the old shielding feature before protocol 7.

Accounts on the Concordium blockchain had two balances, the **Balance** and the shielded balance. You were able to move funds between these
two balances using either a shield CCD transaction or an unshield CCD transaction\`.

When you shield an amount on an account, only the account's credential holder can see the shielded amounts. Other participants in the network will be able to see the shielding transaction, but can't see the shielded balance or any shielded transfers going in or out of the account. You weren't able to make shielded transfers on multi-signature accounts, only on accounts with a single credential.

If you have an account with CCD in the shielded balance, you can't add new credentials to that account. Furthermore, once a shielded transfer has been logged on an account, you'll no longer be able to add more credentials to that account. This is also the case even if you unshield all CCD in the shielded balance.

Do not shield all of your funds or you will not have enough funds to cover transaction fees for unshielding or sending them.

  body={<>
The amount contained in the Balance is publicly visible, while the amount on the Shielded balance is encrypted and is only visible for
the account holder. Moving funds between the balances is also publicly visible, including the amount. Only shielded transfers between
two different accounts have their amounts encrypted.

<Callout
  body={<>
All transfers and transactions cost a fee, including unshielding transactions. The fee is based on the set NRG for that transaction and the current exchange rate.
The cost of transaction fees is stable in Euros, and therefore the price in CCD varies depending on the CCD to EUR exchange rate. The fee will always be deducted from the **Balance** of the account, so it is important to have some available CCDs to cover fees.
You can see the fee in the transaction log.
