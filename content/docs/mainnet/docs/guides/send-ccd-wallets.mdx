This topic describes how you can send CCD from an account when only one participant is required to sign the transfer.

<Callout
  body={<>
All transfers and transactions cost a fee. The fee is based on the set NRG for that transaction and the current exchange rate.
The cost of transaction fees is stable in Euros, and therefore the price in CCD varies depending on the CCD to EUR exchange rate. The fee will always be deducted from the **Balance** of the account, so it is important to have some available CCDs to cover fees.
You can see the fee in the transaction log.

3. Optionally you can add a memo to your transaction by tapping the **Add memo** field. A memo is a short message that will be shown with the transaction. Memos are publicly visible on the chain, so be careful what you write. Adding a memo will also increase the transaction fee.

3. In the right pane, enter the amount of CCD that you want to send. If the amount you want to transfer including the transfer fee exceeds the amount in your account, you’ll see a message saying **Insufficient funds**. This means that there's not enough CCD in the account, and you’ll have to change the amount. Enter a **Memo** if you want to send a message to the recipient along with the amount. Note that there's a fee associated with sending a memo and the fee depends on the size of the memo in bytes. Click **Select Recipient**.
