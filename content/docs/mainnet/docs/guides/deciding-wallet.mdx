## Why you need a wallet

You need a Concordium [wallet](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#wallet) to interact with the Concordium blockchain and manage your CCD tokens. Here are the currently available wallets:

- Desktop Wallet: Offers the highest security but requires a LEDGER device.
- Concordium Wallet for Web: Accessible from any device with a web browser supporting Chrome extensions. Ideal for standard transactions, great for developers and dApp users.
- Concordium Wallet: The latest mobile wallet, user-friendly with both seed phrase and file-based recovery and dApp connectivity.

The wallets are developed by Concordium Software and can only be used to hold [CCD](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#ccd),
the native token of the Concordium blockchain, and [CIS-2 tokens](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/tokens#tokens).
You can't use these wallets for any other crypto currencies.

## Choosing the Right Wallet

Consider these factors when choosing a wallet:

- Security: Desktop Wallet offers the most security with its LEDGER device support.
- Accessibility: Concordium Wallet for Web and Concordium Wallet are more accessible for everyday use.
- Device: Choose a wallet compatible with your device (computer or mobile).
- Features: Concordium Wallet offers the most features, including seed phrase or key file recovery and dApp connectivity.

## Portability limits between wallets

- Identities and accounts cannot be directly transferred between Desktop Wallet and other wallets.
- Concordium Wallet can import accounts from other Concordium wallets via seed phrase of backup file.
- You can always send CCD tokens between any wallets.

## Wallet Backups

- Desktop Wallet: Requires exporting data and keeping the LEDGER recovery phrase safe.
- Concordium Wallet for Web and Concordium Wallet: Securely store the seed phrase generated during setup.

## What are the requirements for each wallet?

- Desktop Wallet: A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux, and a LEDGER NANO S PLUS.
- Concordium Wallet for Web: A device running one of the supported Chromium internet browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge) with the Concordium Wallet for Web extension installed.
- Concordium Wallet: An iPhone running iOS 15 or later or an Android phone running Android 8 or later.
