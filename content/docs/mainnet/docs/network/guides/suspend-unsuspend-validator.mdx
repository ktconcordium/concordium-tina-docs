title: "Suspend/Unsuspend a validator"
---

(suspend-unsuspend-validator)=


A validator can be suspended in two ways:

- **Self-suspension**: You can manually suspend your validator, for example during planned node maintenance.
- **Automatic suspension**: The protocol may suspend your validator if it fails to produce blocks a certain number of times when selected as a round leader.

When a validator is suspended, regardless of the cause:

- The validator stops earning rewards
- Delegators to the validator stop earning rewards
- Delegators are notified about the suspension

## Self-suspension

You can manually suspend your validator when needed, such as during node maintenance, and reactivate it when your node is operational again. This gives you control over your validator's status without risking an automatic suspension due to inactivity.
When your validator is suspended, a red banner will appear on your wallet stating that **Your validation has been suspended**.

![](/images/browser-wallet/new/suspended_banner.png){image} ../../images/browser-wallet/new/primed_for_suspension_banner.png
:width: 50%
```

The validator then has until the next snapshot epoch to demonstrate activity by either producing a block or having its signature included in a quorum certificate. If it remains inactive, the suspension takes effect at the following payday, and the red banner will change to indicate the suspended status.

If your validator has been automatically suspended, you'll need to follow a two-step process to resume validation. First, you must address the underlying issue with your node that caused the inactivity. Check your node's status, identify what caused the suspension, fix these issues, and restart your node to ensure it's properly connected to the network. Once your node is operational again, you can then proceed to your wallet and follow the resume procedure by selecting **Resume** in the validation section.

  #. Go to **Multi Signature Transactions**, select **Make new proposal**, and then select **Update validator suspension**.

  #. Select the **Account** that you no longer want to be a validator account, and then select **Continue**.

  #. Set an expiry date and time for your proposal. You must set the expiry time so that the co-signers can return their signatures in time. Select **Continue**.

  **Generate the transaction**

  There are two ways that you can generate the transaction:

  -  Generate the transaction without signing. This option enables you to export the transaction proposal without signing it. You don’t need a LEDGER device but you do need an internet connection.

  -  Generate and sign the transaction This option requires a LEDGER device and an internet connection.

  In combination, these two options enable you to distribute the responsibility of creating and signing transfers among more people. You can, for example, have one person create the proposal and another one sign the proposal. It also makes it possible for you to sign the transaction on the Ledger in a different location than where the proposal was created.

  *Generate the transaction without signing*

  #. Verify that the **Transaction details** are as you intended, and then select **I am sure that the proposed changes are correct**.

  #. Select **Generate without signing**. You can now export the proposal.

  *Generate and sign the transaction on the LEDGER device*

  #. If you haven't connected the LEDGER device, there's a message in the Desktop Wallet saying **Waiting for connection** until you connect the LEDGER device. Enter your PIN code on the LEDGER device. Press the buttons above the up and down arrows to choose a digit, and then press both buttons to select the digit.

  #. Wait for the message in the Desktop Wallet saying **Open the Concordium application on your Ledger device**. On the LEDGER device, press the right button to navigate to the Concordium app, and then press both buttons to open the app. The LEDGER device says **Concordium is ready**.

  #. In the Desktop Wallet, Verify that the **Transaction details** are as you intended, select **I am sure that the proposed changes are correct**, and then select **Generate and Sign**.

  #. On the LEDGER device, there's a message saying **Review transaction**. Verify that the sender account is correct, and navigate to the right. The LEDGER device says **Validator status: Suspend validator**. Navigate to the right.

  #. The LEDGER device says **Sign transaction**. Press both buttons to sign the transaction. The LEDGER device says **Concordium is ready**.

  In the Desktop Wallet, you can now see **Transaction details**, **Signatures**, and **Security & Submission Details**, which include the status of the transaction, the identicon, and the transaction hash. If you have all the required signatures, you can submit the transaction to the chain, otherwise, you'll have to export the proposal and receive signatures from the co-signers.

  **Export proposal**

  If more than one signature is needed to sign off on the proposal, you have to share a file of the type JSON, which contains the transaction information,  with the co-signers.

  #. In the Desktop Wallet, select **Export transaction proposal**.

  #. Navigate to the location on your computer where you want to save the file. If you're on Windows make sure that **All Files** is selected in **Save as type**. Give the file a name and the extension .json, and then click **Save**.

  #. You have to export the transaction proposal and send it to the co-signer through a secure channel. Optionally, you can also send the Identicon to the co-signers through a different secure channel.

  **Receive signatures from co-signers**

  When the co-signers have signed the transaction, they return the signed transaction proposal to you, and you have to import the files into the Desktop Wallet before you can submit the transaction to the chain.

  #. If you’re still on the same page, go to step 3. If you left the page with the account transaction, go to **Multi-signature Transactions**, and then select Your proposed transactions.

  #. Select the transaction that you want to submit to the chain. You can see an overview of the transaction details and an overview of the signatures. You can also see that the status of the transaction is Unsubmitted, and you can see the identicon and the transaction hash.

  #. Select **Browse to file** and then navigate to the location on your computer where you saved the signed transaction files. Select the relevant files, and then select **OK**. The files are uploaded to the Desktop Wallet and added to the list of signatures. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the signature files from their location on the computer and onto the Desktop Wallet.


  **Submit the transaction to the blockchain**

  When you have received and added all the required signatures, you can submit the transaction to the blockchain.

  #. Review the transaction details carefully to ensure that all information is correct.

  #. Select **I understand this is the final submission, and that it cannot be reverted**.

      If you don’t want to submit the transaction to the chain, you can select **Cancel**. The proposal is no longer active. However, it is still visible in the list of proposals.

  #. Select **Submit transaction to chain**. The transaction is submitted to the chain and finalized on the ledger.
