If the node is [configured with TLS](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/blob/main/docs/grpc2.md#grpc-api-v2), then `CONCORDIUM_NODE_COLLECTOR_GRPC_HOST` must be configured such that it uses the domain of the certificate, for example, `CONCORDIUM_NODE_COLLECTOR_GRPC_HOST=https://example.concordium-node.io:20000`.

## Verify that the node is running

The node runs as a background service with no user interface. To verify that it’s running, use the **Task Manager**.

1. Search for *task* in the **Search** bar, and then select **Task Manager**.

2. Select the **Details** tab, and verify that the following are running:

   - `node-runner-service.exe`, which is the service.

   - `concordium-node.exe` for each node you are running. For example, if you’re running a node on both testnet and mainnet, you’ll see two instances of concordium-node.exe.

   - `node-collector.exe` for each node that reports to the network dashboard.

     ```

2. Select **Set connection**. If the connection works and the node is running properly, there’s a message saying *Successfully connected*.

## Change the node startup settings

If you want to change whether the node runner service starts automatically, you can use the Services app.

1. Search for *services* in the **Search** bar, and then select **Services**.

2. Right-click **Concordium Node Runner Service**, and then select **Properties**.

   ![](/../images/Node-setup-win-6.png)toml
   node.env.CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_DOWNLOAD_BLOCKS_FROM = 'https://catchup.mainnet.concordium.software/blocks.idx'
   ```

   - For testnet, remove the following line from the `[node.testnet]` section:

   ```toml
   node.env.CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_DOWNLOAD_BLOCKS_FROM = 'https://catchup.testnet.concordium.com/blocks.idx'
   ```

   Save the configuration file.

3. In the **Search** bar, search for and select **Stop Concordium Service Node** to stop the node, and then search for and select **Start Concordium Service Node** to restart the node.
