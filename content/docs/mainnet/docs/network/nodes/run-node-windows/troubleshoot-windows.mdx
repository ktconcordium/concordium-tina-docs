This guide describes how to troubleshoot a node running on Windows on the Concordium network.

## View the node logs

You can find the node logs here:

- Mainnet: `C:\ProgramData\Concordium\Node Runner\mainnet\logs`
- Testnet: `C:\ProgramData\Concordium\Node Runner\testnet\logs`

If you specified a different installation folder for the configuration and data, the path might be different.

The files `mainnet.log` and `testnet.log` contain the latest logs, with `mainnet.0.log` and `mainnet.1.log` containing progressively older logs and the same for `testnet.0.log` and `testnet.1.log`.

The log files are rolled when the latest log file exceeds 50 MB. This means that `mainnet.0.log` is renamed to `mainnet.1.log` (replacing the old file if present), `mainnet.log` is renamed to `mainnet.0.log`, and a new, empty `mainnet.log` is created.

The same goes for testnet. `testnet.0.log` is renamed to `testnet.1.log` (replacing the old file if present), `testnet.log` is renamed to `testnet.0.log`, and a new, empty `testnet.log` is created.

When nodes are stopped or started, this is also recorded in the system event log.

1. Search for event in the **Search** bar, and then select **Event Viewer**.

2. Select **Windows Logs**, and then under **Source** look for Concordium Node Runner Service.

## Event viewer

Use the Event viewer to get more information about the problem. In the **Search** bar, search for **Event viewer**. In the **Windows Logs**, click **Application**. Use the warnings and errors to diagnose the issue.

accountmap
blockstate-0.dat
blockstate-1.dat
blockstate-2.dat
treestate-0
treestate-1
treestate-2
```

To resolve a crash or non-starting node, delete files, starting at the largest `i`, until the node starts or until there are no more files in the directory.

- If only one of `treestate-i` or `blockstate-$i.dat` files exists, delete the other and try starting the node.
- Otherwise delete both files of the `treestate-$i` and `blockstate-$i.dat` pair and try starting the node.
