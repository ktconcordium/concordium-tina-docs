You can connect Concordium Wallet and Concordium Wallet for Web to a [dApp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) that has a frontend interface so that you can pay for services.
Connection can be made by either scanning a QR code or from a link to the dApp service.
Then, the dApp can initiate a request that you can confirm from within the wallet.
