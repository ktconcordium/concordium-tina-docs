- Step 1: Install Python3 and Pip

  <accordion
  heading="MacOS"
  docText={<>
    Ensure Python 3 and pip are installed. Check with:

    ```console

    $python3 --version

    ```
    If not installed, run:

    ```console

    $brew install python
    ```
  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  <accordion
    heading="Windows"
    docText={<>

Download and install **Python 3** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). During installation, make sure to check **Add Python to PATH**.

Alternatively, you can install **Python** using the **Windows Store** or **Chocolatey**:

```console

$choco install python

```
Verify the installation:

```console

$python --version
$pip --version
```
    </>}

  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  <accordion
    heading="Linux"
    docText={<>

Most Linux distributions come with **Python 3** pre-installed. Check with:

```console

$python3 --version

```
If not installed, use your distribution's package manager:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```console

$sudo apt update
$sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

```
**CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:**

```console

$sudo yum install python3 python3-pip

```
**Arch Linux:**

```console

$sudo pacman -S python python-pip
```
    </>}

  ```

- Step 2: Install **Pipenv**

  ```{eval-rst}
  <accordion
    heading="MacOS"
    docText={<>

You need ``pipenv`` for managing Python dependencies:

```console

$pip3 install pipenv

```
If you get the error ``command not found: pipenv``, it is because the ``PATH`` for pipenv is not set.
In order to set it, run the following command to see where the user based bin directory is located:

```console

$python3 -m site --user-base

```
Then, copy the resulting location, it will be used to set the path.
Now, open the .zshrc file with your preferred editor, in this tutorial we shall use nano:

```console

$nano ~/.zshrc

```
Next, write the following line, which will include the location you copied previously, followed by /bin in order to export the PATH:

```console

export PATH="$PATH:/Users/<your_user_name>/Library/Python/3.9/bin"

```
Save the file, restart your terminal and run the following command to check if pipenv is installed:

```console

$pipenv --version

```
You should get the installed version outputted now.
Finally, it is also a good idea to install pyenv in order for pipenv to work properly:

```console

$brew install pyenv
```
    </>}

  />
  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  <accordion
    heading="Windows"
    docText={<>

Install ``pipenv`` using pip:

```console

$pip install pipenv

```
If you get the error "command not found: pipenv", you may need to add the Python Scripts directory to your PATH.

To find the Scripts directory location, run:

```console

$python -m site --user-base

```
Add ``\Scripts`` to the end of the returned path. Then add this path to your system's PATH environment variable:

1. Press **Win + R**, type ``sysdm.cpl``, and press **Enter**
2. Click **Environment Variables**
3. Under **User variables**, select **Path** and click **Edit**
4. Click **New** and add the Scripts directory path
5. Click **OK** to save

Restart your command prompt and verify the installation:

```console

$pipenv --version
```
    </>}

  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  <accordion
    heading="Linux"
    docText={<>

Install ``pipenv`` using pip3:

```console

$pip3 install --user pipenv

```
If you get the error "command not found: pipenv", you need to add the local bin directory to your PATH.

Add the following line to your shell configuration file (``~/.bashrc``, ``~/.zshrc``, or ``~/.profile``):

```console

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"

```
Reload your shell configuration:

```console

$source ~/.bashrc

```
Verify the installation:

```console

$pipenv --version
```

  ```

- Step 3: Clone the Concordium Documentation Repository

  ```console
  git clone https://github.com/Concordium/concordium.github.io
  cd concordium.github.io
  ```

- Step 4: Install Dependencies
  Use `pipenv` to install the required dependencies:

  ```console
  pipenv sync --dev
  ```

- Step 5: Install **Graphviz**

  **Graphviz** is needed to render diagrams:

  ```{eval-rst}
  <accordion
    heading="MacOS"
    docText={<>

```console

$brew install graphviz
```
    </>}
    image=""
    fullWidth={true}
  />
  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  <accordion
    heading="Windows"
    docText={<>

Download and install Graphviz from the [official website](https://graphviz.org/download/).

Alternatively, you can use Chocolatey:

```console

$choco install graphviz

```
Or use winget:

```console

$winget install graphviz
```
    </>}

  />
  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  <accordion
    heading="Linux"
    docText={<>

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```console

$sudo apt install graphviz

```
**CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:**

```console

$sudo yum install graphviz

```
**Arch Linux:**

```console

$sudo pacman -S graphviz
```
    </>}

  ```

- Step 6: Build the Documentation (Text Version)
  For building the `mainnet` documentation:

  ```console
  pipenv run make dev-mainnet
  ```

Open your browser and visit <http://localhost:8000> to view the documentation. To stop the server, you can use CRTL+C.

- Step 7: Building Documentation for Deployment
  To build the final version of the documentation:(optional)

  ```console
  pipenv run ./scripts/build.sh
  ```

  This compiles the documentation into a format that can be hosted and accessed by users.

- Step 8: Checking for Dead Links
  This step focuses specifically on ensuring that all hyperlinks within the documentation are functional and lead to valid pages. You can run this command:
  </>}

/>console
pipenv run make linkcheck-mainnet
```

## How to Modify the documentation

The documentation is written in reStructuredText `(.rst files)` and lives in the `source/` directory, within the `mainnet` folder:

- Mainnet documentation: `source/mainnet/`

### Editing the Documentation

1. Locate the relevant `.rst` file in source/mainnet to edit the corresponding text.
2. Edit `.rst` files using reStructuredText syntax, which supports Sphinx directives for code snippets, warnings, notes, etc. Reference materials for reStructuredText basics can be found here:
   <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>

### Handling TODOs

> To display TODO items as warnings when building the documentation, uncomment this line in the `source/mainnet/conf.py` file:

```console
# todo_emit_warnings = True
```

When writing a TODO directive, use:

```console
.. todo::
   Add details here.
```

### Writing Style Guide

Before contributing please read and follow the principles outlined in:

- our style guide: [style-guide](/docs/mainnet/docs/help-and-faq/style-guide#style-guide)
- the Divio documentation guide:
  <https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/>

## How to Contribute Changes and Open a PR

Now that you have the Concordium development environment set up, follow these steps to make changes to the documentation and open a pull request (PR) to contribute your updates.

- Step 1: Create a New Branch

  Before making any changes, create a new branch in your local repository. This ensures that your changes are isolated from the `main` branch.

  ```console
  git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
  ```

  Replace `<your-branch-name>` with a descriptive name related to the changes you plan to make (e.g., `update-installation-guide`).

- Step 2: Make changes

  1. Navigate to the appropriate `.rst` file in the `source/mainnet/` directory, depending on the documentation you want to update.
  2. Edit the `.rst` files using any text editor. Follow the reStructuredText syntax and the Concordium style guide.

- Step 3: Run Linter and Check Links

  Before committing your changes, ensure the documentation passes linting and contains no dead links.

  1. Linting the documentation:

  ```console
  pipenv run make lint
  ```

  2. Checking for dead links (for the mainnet version):

  ```console
  pipenv run make linkcheck-mainnet
  ```

  Resolve any issues that appear during linting or link checking.

- Step 4: Commit & Push your Changes

  Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them to your branch with a descriptive message.

  ```console
  git add .
  git commit -m "Updated installation guide and fixed issues"
  ```

  Now, you can push your changes:

  ```console
  git push origin <your-branch-name>
  ```

- Step 5: Open a Pull Request

  1. Go to the Concordium documentation [repository](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium.github.io) on GitHub.
  2. You should see a prompt to create a pull request for your recently pushed branch. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button.
  3. Add a title and a clear description of the changes you’ve made, including references to any issues or guidelines.
  4. Submit the pull request.

- Step 6: Address Review Feedback

  After submitting the pull request, a reviewer may leave feedback or request changes. Follow the feedback to make any necessary adjustments, then push the changes to your branch:

  ```console
  git add .
  git commit -m "Fixed review comments"
  git push origin <your-branch-name>
  ```

  Once all changes are approved, the pull request will be merged, and your contributions will be included in the official documentation.
