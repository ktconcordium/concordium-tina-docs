```

**Verify download with signature**

To verify that the downloaded file is an official Concordium release, you can verify that the file is signed by Concordium. To do this, you need a signature of the release and a public key.

- {cdw-sig}`Download signature <AppImage>`
- {cdw-pubkey}`Download public key <>`

With the **signature**, the **public key**, and the **downloaded file** all in the same directory, execute the following steps to verify that the file has been signed by Concordium.

In a terminal:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the assets needed to verify.
2. Then paste the first line of the following block into the terminal
3. The command outputs **Signature Verified Successfully** as a result, as inidicated by the second line in the block.

```{code-block} console
:substitutions: true

$openssl pkeyutl -verify -pubin -inkey concordium-desktop-wallet-pubkey.pem -rawin -in concordium-desktop-wallet-1.9.3.AppImage -sigfile concordium-desktop-wallet-1.9.3.AppImage.sig
Signature Verified Successfully
```

Note that this only works for openssl version 3.0.0 and up.
