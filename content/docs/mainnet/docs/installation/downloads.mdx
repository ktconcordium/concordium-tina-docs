From version 2.8.0 the distribution for `cargo-concordium` has been simplified. Now, once you have installed rustup, you can quickly and easily install `cargo-concordium` without downloading a separate package or going through many steps. If you already have `cargo-concordium` installed, you may need to remove the existing `cargo-concordium` from your PATH to be able to update versions in the future.

For information about configuration and the exposed metrics, see the [documentation in the repository](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/blob/main/docs/prometheus-exporter.md).

For node runners using Grafana®, Concordium provides a node performance dashboard using the exposed Prometheus metrics. You can [download it from the Grafana marketplace](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/18983-concordium-node-external/).
