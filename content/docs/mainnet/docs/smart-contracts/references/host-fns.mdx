(host-functions)=


This is a reference of the functions in the `concordium` module supplied by a
host running smart contract Wasm module.

<Callout
  body={<>
These functions are not meant to be called directly by smart contract writers.
Instead, they are to be used behind a more idiomatic, language-specific API
supplied by a library, such as [concordium-std] for Rust.
