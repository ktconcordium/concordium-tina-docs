This guide will show you, how to interact with a smart contract instance, which
means triggering a receive function that, possibly, updates the state of the
instance.

You can also watch a video about how to update a smart contact instance.

```

## Preparation

Make sure that you are [running a node](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/node-requirements#node-requirements) using the latest [Concordium software](/docs/mainnet/docs/installation/downloads#downloads) and that you have a
smart-contract instance on-chain to inspect.

For how to deploy a smart contract module see [deploy-module](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/deploy-module#deploy-module) and for
how to create an instance [initialize-contract](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/initialize-contract#initialize-contract).
:::

Since interactions with a smart contract are transactions, you should also make
sure to have `concordium-client` set up with an account with enough CCD to pay
for the transactions.

<Callout
  body={<>
The cost of this transaction depends on the size of the parameters sent to
the receive function and the complexity of the function itself.
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>


## Interaction

To update an instance with address index `0` using the parameterless
receive function `my_receive` while allowing up to 10000 energy to be used,
run the following command:

```console
$concordium-client contract update 0 --entrypoint my_receive --energy 10000 --sender MyAccount
```

If successful, the output should be similar to the following:

```console
Successfully updated contract instance {"index":0,"subindex":0} using the entrypoint 'my_receive'.
```

As you can see, the subindex defaults to `0`.

### Passing parameters in JSON format

A parameter in JSON format can be passed if a [smart contract schema](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/contract-schema#contract-schema) is supplied, either as a file or embedded in the module.
The schema is used to serialize the JSON into binary. You can read more about JSON parameters [here](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/json-params#json-params).

:::

To update an instance with address index `0` using the receive function
`my_parameter_receive` with a parameter file `my_parameter.json` in JSON
format, run the following command:

```console
$concordium-client contract update 0 --sender MyAccount --entrypoint my_parameter_receive \
         --energy 10000 \
         --parameter-json my_parameter.json
```

If successful, the output should be similar to the following:

```console
Successfully updated contract instance {"index":0,"subindex":0} using the entrypoint 'my_parameter_receive'.
```

Otherwise, an error describing the problem is displayed.

[references-on-chain](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/references/references-on-chain#references-on-chain).
:::

<Callout
  body={<>
If the parameter provided in JSON format does not conform to the type
specified in the schema, an error message will be displayed. For example:

> ```console
> Error: Could not decode parameters from file 'my_parameter.json' as JSON:
> Expected value of type "UInt64", but got: "hello".
> In field 'first_field'.
> In {
>     "first_field": "hello",
>     "second_field": 42
> }.
> ```
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>


<Callout
  body={<>
If a given module does not contain an embedded schema, it can be supplied
using the `--schema /path/to/schema.bin` parameter.
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>


<Callout
  body={<>
CCD can also be transferred to a contract during updates using the
`--amount AMOUNT` parameter.
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>


### Passing parameters in binary format

When passing parameters in binary format, a
[contract schema](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/contract-schema#contract-schema) is not needed.

To update an instance with address index `0` using the receive function
`my_parameter_receive` with a parameter file `my_parameter.bin` in binary
format, run the following command:

```console
$concordium-client contract update 0 --sender MyAccount --entrypoint my_parameter_receive \
         --energy 10000 \
         --parameter-binary my_parameter.bin
```

If successful, the output should be similar to the following:

```console
Successfully updated contract instance {"index":0,"subindex":0} using the entrypoint 'my_parameter_receive'.
```
