This guide explains how to inspect a smart contract instance.
Inspecting an instance shows you its name, owner, module reference, balance,
and receive-functions:

## Preparation

Make sure that you are [running a node](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/node-requirements#node-requirements) using the latest [Concordium software](/docs/mainnet/docs/installation/downloads#downloads) and that you have a
smart-contract instance on-chain to inspect.

For how to deploy a smart contract module see [deploy-module](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/deploy-module#deploy-module) and for
how to create an instance [initialize-contract](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/initialize-contract#initialize-contract).

## Inspection

To inspect, or show, information about a smart contract instance with the
address index `0`, run the following command:

```console
$concordium-client contract show 0
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```console
Contract:        my_contract
Owner:           '4Lh8CPhbL2XEn55RMjKii2XCXngdAC7wRLL2CNjq33EG9TiWxj' (default)
ModuleReference: 'd121f262f3d34b9737faa5ded2135cf0b994c9c32fe90d7f11fae7cd31441e86'
Balance:         0.000000 CCD
Methods:
 - receive_one
     Parameter:
         "<String>"
     Return value:
         "<UInt64>"
 - receive_two
     Return value:
         "<Bool>"
```

[references-on-chain](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/references/references-on-chain#references-on-chain).
:::

The parameter and return values for a method is only shown if the `show` command has
access to a [contract schema](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/contract-schema#contract-schema) that contains that
information for the method.
If the schema is embedded, it will be used implicitly.
Otherwise, a schema can be provided using `--schema /path/to/schema.bin`
parameter.

<Callout
  body={<>
A schema file provided using the `--schema` parameter will take precedence
over an embedded schema.
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>
