(initialize-contract)=


This guide will show you how to initialize a smart contract from a deployed
smart contract module with parameters in JSON or binary format.
Additionally, it will show how to name an instance.

You can also watch a video about initializing smart contract instances.

```

<Callout
  body={<>
Parameters that are passed to the smart contract must be stored in a file. You cannot pass parameters directly on the command-line using `concordium-client`.
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>


## Preparation

Make sure that you are [running a node](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/node-requirements#node-requirements) using the latest [Concordium software](/docs/mainnet/docs/installation/downloads#downloads) and that you have a smart
contract [deployed](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/deploy-module#deploy-module) in some module on-chain.

Since initializing a smart contract is a transaction, you should also make sure
to have `concordium-client` set up with an account with enough CCD to pay for
the transaction.

<Callout
  body={<>
The cost of this transaction depends on the size of the parameters sent to
the init function and the complexity of the function itself.
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>


To ease deployment and initialization, you can use the [Smart contract deploy and initialize tool](https://sctools.mainnet.concordium.software/) instead of the process below. It works with the Concordium Wallet for Web to deploy and initialize smart contracts to Mainnet and Testnet.

## Initialization

To initialize an instance of the parameterless smart contract `my_contract`
from a deployed module with reference
`9eb82a01d96453dbf793acebca0ce25c617f6176bf7a564846240c9a68b15fd2` while
allowing up to 10000 NRG to be used, run the
following command:

```console
$concordium-client contract init \
         9eb82a01d96453dbf793acebca0ce25c617f6176bf7a564846240c9a68b15fd2 \
         --sender my_account \
         --contract my_contract \
         --energy 10000
```

If successful, the output should be similar to the following:

```console
Contract successfully initialized with address: {"index":0,"subindex":0}
```

Seeing this message means that a new on-chain contract instance has been created
with the address shown.

see [references-on-chain](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/references/references-on-chain#references-on-chain).

Using module references directly can be inconvenient; to name them, see

(init-passing-parameter-json)=

### Passing parameters in JSON format

A parameter in JSON format can be passed if a [smart contract schema](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/contract-schema#contract-schema) is supplied, either as a file or embedded in the module.
The schema is used to serialize the JSON into binary. You can read more about JSON parameters [here](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/json-params#json-params).

:::{seealso}
[Read more about why and how to use smart contract schemas](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/contract-schema#contract-schema).

[Parameters can be also passed in binary format](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/initialize-contract#init-passing-parameter-bin).
:::

To initialize an instance of the contract `my_parameter_contract` from the
module with reference
`9eb82a01d96453dbf793acebca0ce25c617f6176bf7a564846240c9a68b15fd2` with a
parameter file `my_parameter.json` in JSON format, run the following command:

```console
$concordium-client contract init \
         9eb82a01d96453dbf793acebca0ce25c617f6176bf7a564846240c9a68b15fd2 \
         --contract my_parameter_contract \
         --energy 10000 \
         --parameter-json my_parameter.json
```

If successful, the output should be similar to the following:

```console
Contract successfully initialized with address: {"index":0,"subindex":0}
```

Otherwise, an error describing the problem is displayed.

<Callout
  body={<>
If the parameter provided in JSON format does not conform to the type
specified in the schema, an error message will be displayed. For example:

> ```console
> Error: Could not decode parameters from file 'my_parameter.json' as JSON:
> Expected value of type "UInt64", but got: "hello".
> In field 'first_field'.
> In {
>     "first_field": "hello",
>     "second_field": 42
> }.
> ```
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>


<Callout
  body={<>
If a given module does not contain an embedded schema, it can be supplied
using the `--schema /path/to/schema.bin` parameter.
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>


<Callout
  body={<>
CCD can also be transferred to a contract instance during initialization
using the `--amount AMOUNT` parameter.
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>

### Passing parameters in binary format

When passing parameters in binary format, a [contract schema](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/contract-schema#contract-schema) is not needed.

To initialize an instance of the contract `my_parameter_contract` from the
module with reference
`9eb82a01d96453dbf793acebca0ce25c617f6176bf7a564846240c9a68b15fd2` with the
parameter file `my_parameter.bin` in binary format, run the following command:

```console
$concordium-client contract init \
         9eb82a01d96453dbf793acebca0ce25c617f6176bf7a564846240c9a68b15fd2 \
         --contract my_parameter_contract \
         --energy 10000 \
         --parameter-bin my_parameter.bin
```

If successful, the output should be similar to the following:

```console
Contract successfully initialized with address: {"index":0,"subindex":0}
```

(naming-an-instance)=

## Naming a contract instance

A contract instance can be given a local alias, or *name*, which makes
referencing it easier.
The name is only stored locally by `concordium-client`, and is not visible
on-chain.

:::{seealso}
For an explanation of how and where the names and other local settings are
stored, see [local-settings](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/references/local-settings#local-settings).
:::

To add a name during initialization, the `--name` parameter is used.

Here, you are initializing the contract `my_contract` from the deployed module
`9eb82a01d96453dbf793acebca0ce25c617f6176bf7a564846240c9a68b15fd2` and naming
it `my_named_contract`:

```console
$concordium-client contract init \
         9eb82a01d96453dbf793acebca0ce25c617f6176bf7a564846240c9a68b15fd2 \
         --contract my_contract \
         --energy 10000 \
         --name my_named_contract
```

If successful, the output should be similar to the following:

```console
Contract successfully initialized with address: {"index":0,"subindex":0} (my_named_contract).
```

Contract instances can also be named using the `name` command.
To name an instance with the address index `0` as `my_named_contract`, run
the following command:

```console
$concordium-client contract name 0 --name my_named_contract
```

If successful, the output should be similar to the following:

```console
Contract address {"index":0,"subindex":0} was successfully named 'my_named_contract'.
```

[references-on-chain](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/references/references-on-chain#references-on-chain).
