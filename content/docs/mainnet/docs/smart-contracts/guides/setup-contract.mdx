(setup-contract)=


This guide documents two different options (*from a template* or *from scratch*) to create a new Concordium smart contract project.
The *from a template* option is available for `cargo-concordium` version 2.2.0 or greater. It provides you with some
smart contract templates. Choose the template that best fits your project scope.
The *from scratch* option guides you through the process when you want to start a new project without any boilerplate code.

(setup-wee-alloc-feature)=

<Callout
  body={<>
To compile your smart contracts, a memory [allocator](https://docs.rs/concordium-std/6.0.0/concordium_std/#use-a-custom-allocator) is used.
`concordium-std` version `<6.0.0` hard-coded the use of the [wee_alloc](https://docs.rs/wee_alloc/) allocator.
In `concordium-std` version `>=6.0.0`, `wee_alloc` is a feature and needs to be explicitly enabled.
When `std` feature is enabled the allocator provided by the Rust standard library is used
by default but when the `wee_alloc` feature is enabled in addition, `wee_alloc` is used instead.

You can enable the `wee_alloc` feature in `concordium-std` version `>=6.0.0` by using:

```rust
[dependencies]
concordium-std = {version = "6.0", features = ["wee_alloc"]}
```

Alternatively, if you want to test with and without `wee_alloc` enabled add a `wee_alloc` feature to the smart contract crate as follows:

```rust
[features]
default = ["std", "wee_alloc"]
std = ["concordium-std/std"]
wee_alloc = ["concordium-std/wee_alloc"]
```

The main reason for using `wee_alloc` instead of the default allocator
is that `wee_alloc` has a smaller code footprint, i.e, the resulting smart contracts modules are going to
be smaller. Smaller modules will be cheaper to deploy and run. Concordium nodes will load the smart contract module
code into memory when executing a smart contract function on-chain. Hence, the smart contract module size
has an impact on the execution cost.

`Wee_alloc` is unmaintained currently and hence an optional feature for backward compatibility.
There are other allocators available, read [sc-costs-custom-allocator](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/best-practices/costs#sc-costs-custom-allocator) for a guide on how to use one.

:::{seealso}
It is possible to build smart contracts without using Rust's `std`.
For more information, see [no-std](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/no-std#no-std).

That is it! You are now ready to develop your own smart contract.
