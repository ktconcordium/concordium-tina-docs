(build-contract)=


The contract development guides help you get started writing smart contracts. Here you have guides to help you set up your tools, test your contract, and more.

Once you are familiar with smart contracts, it is a good idea to read the [Smart contracts best practices](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/best-practices/development#sc-development-best-practices).

To request CCDs for testing, use the buttons in the Concordium Wallets when running Testnet.
  </>}

Before you can start developing smart contracts, you need to [setup the development environment](#setup-env).

You can also watch a video about installing the smart contract tools.

## Rust and Cargo

First, [install rustup], which installs both [Rust] and [Cargo] on your
machine.

<Callout
  body={<>
Currently, Rust toolchain versions up to `1.81` are and newer are not supported by older `cargo-concordium` versions ( \<= `4.0.0`). Update `cargo-concordium` if you see the error `Unexpected byte 0x80. Expected 0x00` as follows:

```console
$ cargo install cargo-concordium
$ cargo concordium --version
$ cargo-concordium 4.1.1
```

The minimum supported rust version is currently version `1.73`
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>


Then use `rustup` to install the Wasm target, which is used for compilation:

```console
$rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## `cargo-concordium`

`cargo-concordium` is the tool for developing smart contracts for the Concordium
blockchain.
It can be used for [compiling](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/compile-module#compile-module) and
[testing](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/integration-test-contract#integration-test-contract) smart contracts, and enables features such as
[building contract schemas](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/build-schema#build-schema).

To install `cargo-concordium` run:

```console
$cargo install --locked cargo-concordium
```

For a description of how to use the `cargo-concordium` run:

```console
$cargo concordium --help
```

To use verifiable builds with cargo-concordium a container runtime such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required.

### VSCode extension

The [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Concordium.concordium-smart-contracts) can help you develop Concordium smart contracts. The extension sets up the editor for development, installs the `cargo-concordium` smart contract development tool for all supported platforms, and provides commands in the editor for the essential workflows, such as building and testing smart contracts.

You can watch a video about how to use the VSCode extension.

```

### Typescript smart contract client generator

The [Typescript smart contract client generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@concordium/ccd-js-gen) helps you generate JavaScript/TypeScript clients for smart contracts on the Concordium blockchain, providing a lower development time and better type-safety.

## Concordium software

The tool to deploy and interact with smart contracts is
[concordium-client](/docs/mainnet/tools/concordium-client#concordium-client). It is distributed as part of the
[Concordium software](/docs/mainnet/docs/installation/downloads#downloads) package.

To ease deployment and initialization, you can use the [Smart contract deploy and initialize tool](https://sctools.mainnet.concordium.software/). It works with the Concordium Wallet for Web to deploy and initialize smart contracts to Mainnet and Testnet.

<Callout
  body={<>
To deploy smart contract modules and interact with the chain, make sure
that you are [running a node](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/run-node-docker/run-node-docker#run-a-node).
