(introduction)=




Already know what smart contracts are? Go to the [quick start guide](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/guides/quick-start#sc-quick-start) to start building smart contracts on Concordium right away.

A [smart contract](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#smart-contract) is a user-supplied piece of code submitted to the Concordium
blockchain, used to define behavior that is not directly part of the core
protocol. Smart contracts are executed by nodes in the Concordium network
according to predefined rules. Their execution is fully transparent, and all
nodes must agree on what the outcome of execution is based on only publicly
available information.

A smart contract can receive, hold and send CCD, it is able to observe some
aspects of the chain, and maintain its own state. Smart contracts are always
executed as a response to **external** actions, e.g., an account sending a
message. In practice, smart contracts will often be a small part of a larger
system, combining on and off-chain functionality. An example of off-chain
functionality could be a server that invokes the smart contract based on
data from the real-world, such as prices of stocks, or weather information.

## Auction smart contract example

A use case for smart contracts could be for holding an auction; here you program
the smart contract to accept different bids from anyone and have it keep track
of the highest bidder.
When the auction is over, the smart contract sends the winner bid CCD to the seller and all other bids back. The seller then should send the item to the winner.

The smart contract replaces the main role of the auctioneer. The contract itself
only governs the bidding part, and the on-chain distribution of CCDs. It will
likely also need some logic for reimbursing the highest bidder if the seller
does not fulfil their obligations. This will most likely mean that the contract
needs to support some notion of proof that the seller has indeed fulfilled their
obligation, or some way for the highest bidder to file a complaint. Smart
contracts cannot resolve these real-world issues automatically, and the best
solution is likely going to depend on the specifics of the auction. You can find
an example implementation of the auction contract on [this repository](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/examples/auction)
