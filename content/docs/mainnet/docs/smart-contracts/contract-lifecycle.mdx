(sc-lifecycle)=


A smart contract is first deployed to the chain as part of a [contract
module](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/contract-module#contract-module). After this a smart contract can be *initialized* to
obtain a [smart contract instance](/docs/mainnet/docs/smart-contracts/contract-instances#contract-instances). Finally a smart
contract instance can be repeatedly updated according to its own logic.
Before you can follow this guide, you need to [setup the development environment](/docs/shared/setup-env#setup-env).
