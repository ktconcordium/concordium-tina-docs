(key-derivation)=


Concordium employs a [SLIP-10/BIP32](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0010.md) hierarchial key derivation scheme to generate all cryptographic key material required for account creation and operation on the blockchain.

Each account is associated with an Identity Credential issued to the user by an [Identity Provider (IDP)](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#identity-provider).
This structure is reflected in the key derivation tree structure:

- Each Identity Provider has its own subtree
- Within each IDP subtree, there are individual subtrees for each Identity Credential issued to the user

The subtree of a single Identity Credential consists of:

- A subtree dedicated to account signature keys used to sign transfers
- Multiple subtrees that generate cryptographic material for the ID object itself
