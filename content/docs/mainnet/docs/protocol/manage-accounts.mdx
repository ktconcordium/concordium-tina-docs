Accounts and identities are strongly linked on the Concordium platform. To participate on the blockchain - whether holding [CCD](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#ccd), making [transactions](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#transaction), or [validating](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#validator) - you need both an account and an [identity](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#identity). This is regardless of whether you are using one of the [Concordium wallets](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#wallet) or [Concordium Client](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#concordium-client) for your transactions.

You must have a verified identity and a user identity certificate issued by an authorized [identity provider](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#identity-provider) to create accounts on the Concordium platform.

For detailed information about identities, see [Identity framework on Concordium](/docs/mainnet/docs/protocol/identity#reference-identity).

For comprehensive developer documentation on the Concordium Client, see the [the Conclordium Client documentation](/docs/mainnet/tools/concordium-client#concordium-client).

## What is an account

An account on the Concordium blockchain is owned by one or more [credential holders](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#credential-holder) and consists of two parts: The [on-chain](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#on-chain) part, which is publicly visible and maintained by the [validators](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#validator), and the [off-chain](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#off-chain) part.

The on-chain part of the account consists of:

- the credentials of the credential holders associated with the account
- the public balance
- the account sequence number
- the public keys of each credential to verify transaction signatures.

The off-chain part of the account contains:

- the private keys of credential holders which are used to sign actions by the
  account (e.g., sending transfers or deploying smart contracts)
- the identity an account is created from (needed for managing
  the account on the chain)

It is possible to create a shared account where multiple users share one account. For more information, see [Overview of shared accounts with multiple credentials](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/overview-shared-accounts#overview-shared-accounts).

## How to use an account

Concordium provides several ways of interacting with the on-chain account.
The same account can be used from multiple devices simultaneously, and off-chain parts of accounts can be transferred between different devices.

Concordium offers wallet applications in {doc}`mobile, browser and desktop versions<../guides/deciding-wallet>`.

Accounts on the chain are identified by an account address, which is a 32-byte
sequence. When using a Concordium wallet, however, you'll typically assign an **account name**
to make the account easier to identify. This is only a local alias not used by the Concordium blockchain - the name gets resolved to an actual address before any blockchain interactions.

## How to get an account

Once you have a verified identity and user identity certificate, you can create accounts through your chosen wallet application. The process varies slightly depending on which wallet you use:

- Concordium Wallet and Concordium Wallet for Web: You create all accounts yourself directly in the wallet.
- Desktop Wallet: The identity provider creates an [initial account](/docs/mainnet/docs/protocol/account-concepts#initial-accounts) for you during identity verification, though you may want to create additional regular accounts for enhanced privacy.

Account creation is an on-chain transaction that submits a credential containing cryptographic proofs to the blockchain. These proofs verify your identity without revealing personal information.
