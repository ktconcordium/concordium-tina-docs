An important feature of Concordium is the ability to disclose a user's identity and any associated accounts if there is a legal need. This is reserved for exceptional cases of malpractice, and requires a court order to authorise the request. There are two legal scenarios in the context of Identity Disclosure: investigation of on-chain activity (initialized with an account number) and investigation of a person of interest (initialized with off-chain identifying data).

To maintain process integrity, all communication occurs through the Authority - there is no direct communication between Identity Providers and Privacy Guardians.

## Legal scenario 1: Investigation of on-chain activity

1. The Authority that is conducting the investigation must obtain a court order from the legal jurisdiction of the Privacy Guardian (PG).
2. The Authority initiates the identity disclosure process by presenting an official court order to the PGs from their respective jurisdictions, along with the encrypted public holder identifier (obtained from blockchain data) corresponding to the account being investigated.
3. Each PG uses its private decryption key to decrypt its share of the public holder identifier and transmits the resulting string back to the Authority.
4. Upon receiving the necessary threshold of valid responses (currently 2 out of 3 threshold), the Authority combines the decrypted shares to reconstruct the public holder identifier.
5. The Authority issues a formal request and submits the reconstructed public holder identifier to the relevant Identity Provider (IDP). If the IDP is in a different jurisdiction than the PG, an additional court order needs to be obtained by the Authority from the home country of the IDP.
6. The Identity Provider searches its internal database for a match to the public holder identifier provided by the Authority. Upon having located the database entry corresponding to the public holder identifier, the IDP sends the account holder identity record to the Authority. At this point, the disclosure process has successfully revealed a verified identity for an account or wallet address.

Once the identity has been revealed, it is possible to find additional accounts that are linked to it. This can be done via a full person to accounts disclosure scenario (detailed below) or via encrypted mapping information stored in the IDP. Both are dependent on a court order.
