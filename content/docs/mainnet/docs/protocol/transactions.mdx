(transactions)=


A transaction on the Concordium blockchain is an operation which applies some change to the chain. All transactions are recorded on the chain and once recorded, they are immutable. A transaction always has one sender [account](/docs/mainnet/docs/resources/glossary#account) and is signed using the keys of this account.

The most basic transaction is the CCD transfer that is used to send CCD from one account to another. However, there are several transaction types on the Concordium blockchain.

You can make transactions using one of the Concordium wallets or the Concordium Client. Note that some wallets do not support all transaction types, and that you need a LEDGER device to submit transactions from the Desktop Wallet.
