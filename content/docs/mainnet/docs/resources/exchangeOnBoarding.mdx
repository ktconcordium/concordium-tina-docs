This guide will help you add Concordium's native token (CCD) to your cryptocurrency exchange.

Before you start, it is a good idea to read about the core concepts of the Concordium blockchain,
particularly [identities](/docs/mainnet/docs/protocol/identity#reference-identity) and [accounts](/docs/mainnet/docs/protocol/manage-accounts#managing_accounts). The [Concordium Whitepaper](https://docs.concordium.com/governance/whitepaper/Concordium%20White%20Paper.pdf) provides a comprehensive overview of these concepts.

## Identity creation

Concordium requires identity verification before account creation, which is a fundamental part of its regulatory compliance framework.

### Mainnet identity creation

**For Individual Identities:**

- You can use any of the Concordium wallets by following the documentation at [Create an identity](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/create-identity#create-initial-account)

**For Company Identities:**

- Follow the documentation at [Company Identity Creation](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/company-identity/company-identities#company-identities)
- This process involves identity verification through Concordium's approved identity providers

### Testnet identity creation

**For Both Individual and Company Identities:**

- No formal verification is required
- For individual identities, use [any of the Concordium wallets](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/create-identity#create-initial-account)
- For company identities, follow the documentation at [Company Identity Creation](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/company-identity/company-identities#company-identities)

## Account creation

Once you have a verified identity, you can create multiple accounts from it.

- Up to 25 initial accounts can be created from a single identity
- Accounts can be created using any Concordium wallet, follow the documentation at [create an account](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/create-account#create-account) for more information

## Node setup

Running your own node is essential for exchange integration.

### Hardware requirements

Before setting up a node, ensure your hardware meets the [requirements for running a node](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/node-requirements#system-requirements-node-mainnet).

### Node distributions

Node distributions for different platforms are available at the [Downloads page](/docs/mainnet/docs/installation/downloads#node-downloads).

### Platform-specific setup instructions

- [Ubuntu Node](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/run-node-ubuntu/run-node-ubuntu#run-node-ubuntu)
- [Docker Node](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/run-node-docker/run-node-docker#run-a-node)
- [Windows Node](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/run-node-windows/run-node-windows#run-node-windows)
- [macOS Node](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/run-node-macos/run-node-macos#run-node-macos)
- [AWS Node](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/run-node-aws/run-node-aws#run-a-node-aws)

For custom node setups, contact [Concordium Support](mailto:support@concordium.software).

## Integration methods

Concordium offers several methods for integrating with the blockchain:

### SDKs

You can use one of the official Concordium [SDKs](/docs/mainnet/tools/sdks-apis#sdks-apis):

- [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node-sdk-js)
- [Rust SDK](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-sdk)
- [.NET (C#) SDK](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-net-sdk)
- [Java SDK](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-java-sdk)
- [Go SDK](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-go-sdk)

### Rosetta API

Concordium provides an adapter to expose the [Rosetta API](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rosetta), which is useful for exchanges already supporting this standard.

### gRPC V2 interface

Concordium provides a gRPC V2 interface as well, details can be found in this [documentation article](/docs/mainnet/tools/grpc2#grpc2-documentation).

## Transactions

### Checking for incoming transactions

**Node Query Method**

- The most reliable method is to [query your node](/docs/mainnet/tools/query-node#testnet-query-node) directly

**Transaction Logger**

- Alternatively, you can run a [transaction logging service](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-transaction-logger)
- This service logs transactions to a database where you can efficiently lookup the transaction for a specific account

### Transfer CCD on withdrawal request

- Use the [SDK](/docs/mainnet/tools/sdks-apis#sdks-apis) of your choice to implement CCD transfers.
- Transfer of CCD is also possible with [gRPC](/docs/mainnet/tools/grpc2#grpc2-documentation).

## FAQ

### Account aliases

**Q: Do we have to create a company identity for each account?**

> - No, one identity can have multiple accounts. Once you have a verified identity object, you can generate as many accounts as you need from it. It should not be necessary for you to have several identities, one will suffice.
>   For your users, the recommended setup is to use [account aliases](/docs/mainnet/docs/protocol/account-aliases#account-aliasses):
>
>   - This means that you create one or more omnibus accounts and generate aliases/subaccounts for individual user transfers
>   - Subaccounts share the same private key but have different addresses, making it easy to organize user deposits and withdrawals
>   - Each account can have up to 2^24 aliases (approximately 16 million)

### Transfer with MEMO

**Q: How can we include additional data with transactions?**

> - Concordium supports memo transfers, which allow you to attach additional data to a transaction. This is useful for exchange integrations to track user deposits:
>
>   - Memo transfers can be implemented through any of the Concordium [SDKs](/docs/mainnet/tools/sdks-apis#sdks-apis) or through [gRPC](/docs/mainnet/tools/grpc2#grpc2-documentation)

### Transaction confirmation

**Q: When is a transaction considered confirmed?**

> - Concordium has explicit finalization:
>
>   - Once a block is created, it usually takes 1-2 seconds to be finalized
>   - Average block time is about 2 seconds
>   - The node will report a transaction as finalized once it's in a finalized block
>   - Finalization is not based on the number of successor blocks

### Getting testnet CCDs

**Q: How do I get CCDs for testing on testnet?**

> - For individual accounts:
>
>   - Request a CCD drop directly through the [Concordium wallets](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/setup-wallets-lp#setup-wallets-lp)
>
> - For company accounts:
>
>   ```console
>   $ curl -X PUT https://wallet-proxy.testnet.concordium.com/v0/testnetGTUDrop/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
>   ```
>
>   - Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` with your account address. You can only request one CCD drop per account.
