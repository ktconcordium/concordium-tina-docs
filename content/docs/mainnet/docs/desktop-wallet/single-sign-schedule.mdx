(ccd-single-schedule-desktop)=


This topic describes how you can send CCD from an account with only one signer with a schedule. If you want to learn about sending CCD with a schedule when more co-signers are required, see [Create a scheduled multi-signature CCD transfer in the Desktop Wallet](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/multisig-transfer#create-multisig-scheduled).

You can create two types of release schedules: a regular interval
schedule and an explicit schedule.

- Use a regular interval schedule to release an equal amount of CCD to
  a recipient at regular intervals.
- Use an explicit schedule if you want the intervals between releases
  to be of different lengths, and if you want to be able to release
  different amounts of CCD to the recipient at each interval.

1. Go to **Accounts** and select the relevant account.
2. Select **More options**, and then select **Send CCD with a schedule**
3. Enter the amount of CCD that you want to send. If the amount you want to transfer including the transfer fee exceeds the amount in your account, you’ll see a message saying **Insufficient funds**. This means that there's not enough CCD in the account and you’ll have to change the amount. You can see the estimated transaction fee of the transfer under **Transaction Details**.
4. Optionally, enter a **Memo** if you want to send a message to the recipient along with the transfer. Note that there's a fee associated with sending a memo and the fee depends on the size of the memo in bytes.

<Callout
  body={<>
Transaction memos are public and visible on the blockchain, and they are permanent and can't be deleted. Therefore, carefully review all information before you submit the memo to the blockchain.
