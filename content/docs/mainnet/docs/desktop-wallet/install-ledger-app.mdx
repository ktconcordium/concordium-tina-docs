## Set up the LEDGER device

The LEDGER device will generate the unique 24-word recovery phrase that is used to derive your private keys.

1. Download and install **Ledger Live**. For information on how to do this, see [Ledger's documentation](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download). You'll only need Ledger Live when you set up the LEDGER device and update the firmware.
2. Open **Ledger Live**, select **Get started**, and then select **Ledger device**.
3. Follow the on-screen setup instructions to set up your PIN code on the LEDGER device.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to get your 24-word recovery phrase.

<Callout
  body={<>
Make sure that you write down the recovery phrase precisely as displayed and in the correct order. The recovery phrase is the only backup of your private keys.
