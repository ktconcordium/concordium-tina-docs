This topic describes the information and the tasks that are available in the Desktop Wallet. To learn more about creating accounts, see [Create an account in the Desktop Wallet](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/create-account#create-account).

To view information about an account, go to **Accounts** and select the relevant account. At the top of the window you see the following:

![example of account card with information, validator icon, ledger icon shown](/../images/desktop-wallet/dw-acct-card-in-list.png)

- The **Account Total** shows the total number of CCDs on the account, which includes the CCDs that are available and any staked CCDs or shielded CCDs ([deprecated](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/shield-ccd-wallets#shielded-balance-feature-deprecation)). It also includes CCDs that are scheduled to be released to your account on a future date.
- The **Balance Total** shows the total number of CCD on the account, which includes the CCD that is available and any staked CCD or CCDs that are scheduled to be released to your account on a future date. It does *not* include shielded CCDs ([deprecated](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/shield-ccd-wallets#shielded-balance-feature-deprecation)).
- The **At disposal** amount is the amount you can use for transactions, which excludes staked CCD and CCD in a release schedule.
- The **Staked** amount shows the amount staked if the account is a validator or delegator.
- **Shielded balance** shows any shielded amounts ([deprecated](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/shield-ccd-wallets#shielded-balance-feature-deprecation)) on the account.

In addition, you can see the following information about the selected account on the **Balance** tab in the account details:

- **Transaction log**. View a list of transactions on the account. Use **Filters** to specify which transaction types you want to be displayed in the **Transfers** list. See [Apply a transaction log filter](/docs/mainnet/docs/desktop-wallet/transaction-log-filter#transaction-log).
- **Send CCD with a schedule**: Send CCD according to a schedule. See [Transfer CCD with a schedule](/docs/mainnet/docs/desktop-wallet/single-sign-schedule#CCD-single-schedule-desktop).
- **Inspect release schedule**: Shows any future CCD releases that are scheduled to be released on your account.
- **Export account reports**: Export a file with a list of all transactions on the account. Set the relevant time period and filters, and then select **Make account report**. Save the export as a .csv file.
- **Credentials and attribute information**: Here you can see all credential ID that are associated with the account and the attributes that are revealed for each credential ID (if any). You can also see the creation dates and valid to dates of the credentials. One or more credentials can be associated with an account.
- **Update credentials**: Add new credentials to the account. See [Add credentials to an account](/docs/mainnet/docs/guides/multi-credentials#multi-credentials).
- **Register data**: Add a small message to the chain, such as a hash. This information is visible on the chain and cannot be removed. Note that adding this message incurs a transaction fee.
- **Register as a validator**: Make the account a validator account. See [Add a validator account in the Desktop Wallet](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/guides/add-baker-mw#add-baker-mw). If the account is already a validator account, you'll see **Validation** which contains a list of options for managing a validator account: [Remove validator](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/guides/update-baker-mw#remove-baker-mw), [Update validator keys](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/guides/update-baker-mw#update-baker-keys-mw), [Update validator stake](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/guides/update-baker-mw#update-baker-stake-mw), and [Update validator restake earnings](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/guides/update-baker-mw#update-baker-stake-mw).
- **Register as a delegator**: Register the account as a delegator. See [Delegation](/docs/mainnet/docs/protocol/concepts-delegation#delegation-concept) for information about delegation. If you are already delegating, you'll see **Delegation** which contains a list of options for managing delegation.

## Desktop Wallet settings

The Desktop Wallet has a number of settings such as password and node settings that you access by going to the **Settings** page.

### Preferences

The Desktop Wallet provides a set of multi-signature transactions called Foundation transactions that only members of the Concordium Foundation can sign.

These transactions are disabled by default, and if you're not a member of the Concordium Foundation it is strongly recommended that you don't enable them. If you do enable the transactions, they will be listed on the multi-signature transactions page. However, you'll not be able to actually sign or submit any of these transactions.

### Node settings

Here you specify which node on the blockchain that you want to connect to.

- If you're running the **mainnet** version of the Desktop Wallet, you must connect to a mainnet node. In the **Address field**, enter `127.0.0.1` and in the **Port field** enter `20000`.
- If you're running the **testnet** version of the Desktop Wallet, you must connect to a testnet node. In the **Address** field, enter `127.0.0.1` and in the **Port field** enter `20001`.
- Select **Set connection**. If the connection works, there's a message saying **Successfully connected**.

You can run a node using [Windows](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/run-node-windows/run-node-windows#run-node-windows), [macOS](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/run-node-macos/run-node-macos#run-node-macos), and [with Docker](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/run-node-docker/run-node-docker#run-a-node) or [a Debian package](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/nodes/run-node-ubuntu/run-node-ubuntu#run-node-ubuntu) on Linux.
