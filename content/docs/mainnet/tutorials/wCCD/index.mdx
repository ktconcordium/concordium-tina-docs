In this tutorial, you are going to get familiar with the deployed wCCD token on testnet.
You are going to write a basic web frontend example that can read from and write to the deployed wCCD smart contract on testnet.

In the [first part](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/wCCD/wCCD-introduction#wCCD-introduction), you will learn more about the wCCD token protocol.

In the [second part](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/wCCD/wCCD-interacting#wCCD-interacting), you will interact with the wCCD token protocol using the `concordium-client`.

In the [third part](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/wCCD/wCCD-frontend-set-up#wCCD-frontend-set-up), you will download the browser wallet and set up a basic web frontend locally that you can use to interact with the wCCD token protocol.
