```

A sponsored transaction decouples the transaction fee authorization (third-party wallet) from the action authorization (user's wallet).
The user signs a message (in that case the prepend is `account` address and 8 zero bytes) to authorize the `action`. Hence, the 8 zero bytes ensure that the user does not accidentally sign a valid transaction. This means the red signature is not a transaction, while the black signature is a valid transaction in the image below. The user's signature is sent to the backend server.
The third-party creates a valid transaction at the backend server, which is sent to the blockchain.
