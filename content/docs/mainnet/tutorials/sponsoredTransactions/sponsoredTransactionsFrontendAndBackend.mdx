title: "Sponsored Transactions Frontend and Backend"
---

(sponsoredtransactionsfrontendandbackend)=


The goal of this part of the tutorial is to set up the frontend and the backend locally and to understand the two flows that the dApp provides.

You can explore the [hosted sponsored transaction service](https://sponsored.testnet.concordium.com).
The sponsored transaction service consists of a frontend and a backend. You can start your own service by
following the instructions in the [frontend README.md file](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-dapp-examples/blob/main/sponsoredTransactions/frontend/README.md)
and then the instructions in the [backend README.md file](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-dapp-examples/blob/main/sponsoredTransactions/backend/README.md).
Alternatively, follow the steps in the [README.md file](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-dapp-examples/blob/main/sponsoredTransactions/README.md) to deploy the Docker container.
The docker container will set up the frontend as well as the backend.

Comprehensive instructions on how to set up the Concordium Wallet for Web, create an account in the Concordium Wallet for Web,
get some testnet CCD and run a local frontend can be found in [wCCD frontend-set-up section](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/wCCD/wCCD-frontend-set-up#wCCD-frontend-set-up).

The frontend supports the following two flows with the Concordium Wallet for Web (or Concordium Wallet for Mobile that uses WalletConnect):

- Create the message of a sponsored `updateOperator` transaction => Sign it with the wallet => Submit the signature to the `/submitUpdateOperator` backend endpoint.
- Mint an NFT to your wallet account => Create the message of a sponsored `transfer` transaction => Sign it with the wallet => Submit the signature to the `/submitTransfer` backend endpoint.

The backend is a server that exposes two endpoints:

- `POST /submitUpdateOperator`
- `POST /submitTransfer`

After submitting the signature to the `/submitUpdateOperator` or the `/submitTransfer` endpoint,
the backend creates a sponsored transaction and submits it on-chain to the `permit` function in the smart contract {index: [SMART_CONTRACT_INDEX](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-dapp-examples/blob/main/sponsoredTransactions/frontend/package.json#L41), subindex: 0}.
The deployed smart contract code can be found [here](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/examples/cis3-nft-sponsored-txs).
After the transaction is sent to the blockchain node, the backend returns the transaction hash to the frontend.

The backend server has to have access to a blockchain node and an account (with its associated private key)
that is funded with some CCD to submit the sponsored transaction to the chain. The backend wallet
will pay for the transaction fees on behalf of the user.

## Schemas

The frontend uses several `json` schemas in the `./frontend/src/constants.ts` file such as:

```javascript
export const UPDATE_OPERATOR_SCHEMA = 'EAEUAAIAAAAGAAAAdXBkYXRlFQIAAAAGAAAAUmVtb3ZlAgMAAABBZGQCCAAAAG9wZXJhdG9yFQIAAAAHAAAAQWNjb3VudAEBAAAACwgAAABDb250cmFjdAEBAAAADA';

export const TRANSFER_SCHEMA = 'EAEUAAUAAAAIAAAAdG9rZW5faWQdAAYAAABhbW91bnQbJQAAAAQAAABmcm9tFQIAAAAHAAAAQWNjb3VudAEBAAAACwgAAABDb250cmFjdAEBAAAADAIAAAB0bxUCAAAABwAAAEFjY291bnQBAQAAAAsIAAAAQ29udHJhY3QBAgAAAAwWAQQAAABkYXRhEAEC';

export const SERIALIZATION_HELPER_SCHEMA = 'FAAFAAAAEAAAAGNvbnRyYWN0X2FkZHJlc3MMBQAAAG5vbmNlBQkAAAB0aW1lc3RhbXANCwAAAGVudHJ5X3BvaW50FgEHAAAAcGF5bG9hZBABAg==';

export const NONCE_OF_PARAMETER_SCHEMA = 'FAABAAAABwAAAHF1ZXJpZXMQARQAAQAAAAcAAABhY2NvdW50Cw==';

export const NONCE_OF_RETURN_VALUE_SCHEMA = 'FAEBAAAAEAEF';

export const MINT_PARAMETER_SCHEMA = 'FAABAAAABQAAAG93bmVyFQIAAAAHAAAAQWNjb3VudAEBAAAACwgAAABDb250cmFjdAEBAAAADA==';
```

These schemas can be generated [in the smart contract folder](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/examples/cis3-nft-sponsored-txs) with the command below.

```rust
cargo concordium build --schema-json-out ./
```

This command creates a file with the JSON schema of your smart contract in your current directory.

## Explore your public key

You can export your keys file from the Concordium Wallet for Web as follows:

![](./images/pic1.png){image} ./images/pic2.png
:width: 30 %
```

![](./images/pic3.png){image} ./images/updateOperator.gif
:align: center
:alt: Update operator gif
```

The GIF shows an example of input parameters that can be used to successfully execute a sponsored `updateOperator` transaction.
The transaction should be successfully submitted by the backend to the blockchain which can be checked on the
blockchain explorer by clicking the transaction hash displayed at the frontend.

When exploring the code, you will realize that the input parameter to the `permit` function
and the `message` that is signed in the wallet are rather complex. For example, the `message` for the sponsored `updateOperator` transaction is as follows:

```javascript
const operatorAction = addOperator
   ? {
      Add: [],
   }
   : {
      Remove: [],
   };

const updateOperator = [
   {
      operator: {
         Account: [operator],
      },
      update: operatorAction,
   },
];

const payload = serializeTypeValue(updateOperator, toBuffer(UPDATE_OPERATOR_SCHEMA, 'base64'));

const message = {
   contract_address: {
      index: Number(process.env.SMART_CONTRACT_INDEX),
      subindex: 0,
   },
   nonce: Number(nonce),
   timestamp: expiryTimeSignature,
   entry_point: 'updateOperator',
   payload: Array.from(payload),
};
```

Because the schema is included in the smart contract, you can use the format returned by the below command to get a
template for how to create the `message` and input parameters for the functions in the smart contract:

```rust
cargo concordium build --schema-template-out -
```

The above command will print the schema template to the console. The command has to be executed
[in the smart contract folder](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/examples/cis3-nft-sponsored-txs).

## Submit a sponsored `transfer` transaction

![Transfer gif](./images/transfer.gif)javascript
const transfer = [
   {
      amount: '1',
      data: [],
      from: {
         Account: [from],
      },
      to: {
         Account: [to],
      },
      token_id: tokenID,
   },
];

const payload = serializeTypeValue(transfer, toBuffer(TRANSFER_SCHEMA, 'base64'));

const message = {
   contract_address: {
      index: Number(process.env.SMART_CONTRACT_INDEX),
      subindex: 0,
   },
   nonce: Number(nonce),
   timestamp: expiryTimeSignature,
   entry_point: 'transfer',
   payload: Array.from(payload),
};
```

Because the schema is included in the smart contract, you can use the format returned by the below command to get a
template on how to create the `message` and input parameters for the functions in the smart contract:

```rust
cargo concordium build --schema-template-out -
```

The above command will print the schema template to the console. The command has to be executed
[in the smart contract folder](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/examples/cis3-nft-sponsored-txs).

The NFT smart contract used in the hosted demo app is meant for exploring sponsored transactions.
To ease this process, the mint function can be called by any account to mint a token.
`Token_ids` are stored in the smart contract in little-endian order and a counter is used to
increase the `token_id` by 1 every time the mint function is invoked. The wallet displays the `token_id` bytes in a hex string.
In other words, the first token minted will have the `token_id=01000000`,
the second token minted will have `02000000`, ..., `0f000000`, `10000000`, ..., `ff000000`, `00010000`, ... .
You can look up your minted `token_id` in the Concordium Wallet for Web by getting the smart contract
index as seen below and searching for tokens in that contract that are owned by your account.
