title: "Mint and transfer semi-fungible token"

(mint-xfer-sft)=


You have a contract instance which means you have an empty state and are ready to mint some tokens! You will be using [this metadata](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZ3939dLLFzvYZjFnkdqACe2n9TQA8Rx4efbjaYTXteeu) and minting 100 of [this cool image](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNqv1QnZw6j6N3ueqCA6VotciHUopRAvZqY8JBnheoLk6).

Create a folder called `nft-artifacts` and create a JSON file called `mint-params.json` in the folder to execute these steps properly. In the JSON file, you are going to give the minting parameters to the MintParams which you worked on a little in the beginning.

```json
{
    "owner": {
        "Account": [
            "<YOUR-ACCOUNT-ADDRESS>"
        ]
    },
    "tokens": [
        [
            "01",
            [
                {
                    "url": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZ3939dLLFzvYZjFnkdqACe2n9TQA8Rx4efbjaYTXteeu",
                    "hash": "f982b4603b9c116598d381d1aee90a7b5332377b209b6bbd8d7a4dfab18f2a80"
                },
                "100"
            ]
        ]
    ]
}
```

Then run the command below to invoke the mint function with the given params.

```console
concordium-client contract update <YOUR-CONTRACT-INSTANCE> --entrypoint mint --parameter-json nft-artifacts/mint-params.json --schema dist/smart-contract-multi/schema.bin --sender <YOUR-ADDRESS> --energy 6000 --grpc-port 20001
```

You have just minted your semi-fungible token successfully.

## View contract state and metadata

Now check the state of your contract. Remember this is a state-keeping machine. You will use the extracted schema file to view what is going on with your smart contract. Run the following command; you will need to know your contract index and have the schema file.

```console
concordium-client contract invoke <YOUR-CONTRACT-INSTANCE> --entrypoint view --schema  dist/smart-contract-multi/schema.bin
```

![](/images/contract-state.png)console
concordium-client contract invoke <YOUR-INDEX> --entrypoint tokenMetadata --parameter-json nft-artifacts/ids.json --schema dist/smart-contract-multi/schema.bin --grpc-port 20001
```

The metadata URL is stored permanently on Concordium.

![](/images/metadata-url.png)json
[
    {
        "token_id": "<YOUR-TOKEN-ID>",
        "amount": "1",
        "from": {"Account": ["<OWNER-ACCOUNT>"]},
        "to": {"Account": ["<RECIPIENT-ACCOUNT>"]},
        "data": ""
    }
]
```

Once your `transfer.json` file is complete, run the command below.

```console
concordium-client contract update <YOUR-INDEX> --entrypoint transfer --parameter-json nft-artifacts/transfer.json --schema dist/smart-contract-multi/schema.bin --sender <YOUR-ACCOUNT> --energy 6000 --grpc-port 20001
```

The transfer is successful.

You have now completed the SFT minting tutorial.
