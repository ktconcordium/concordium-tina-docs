In this tutorial, you are going to build a simple smart contract modelling a
piggy bank.
It should allow any account to insert CCD and only the owner to smash it,
taking all of the CCD inside.

In the [first part](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/piggy-bank/writing#piggy-bank-writing), you will learn how to write the very basic piggy bank smart
contract using the [Rust] programming language.

The [second part](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/piggy-bank/testing#piggy-bank-testing) is about how to test your piggy bank smart contract with integration tests.

The [third part](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/piggy-bank/deploying#piggy-bank-deploying) is about how to deploy your piggy bank smart contract to the Concordium testnet and interact with it.

Finally, the [fourth part](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/piggy-bank/frontend#piggy-bank-frontend) explains how to set up a web-based frontend for interacting with the piggy bank smart contract.

The reader is assumed to have basic knowledge of what a blockchain and smart
contracts are, and to have some experience with [Rust]. Consider reading the
simpler [Counter smart contract tutorial](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/counter/counter-contract#counter-sc) first.
