(mint-transfer)=


Now, you are ready to call the mint function. In order to invoke the mint function, you need the contract instance and you must set the owner/minter address, the metadata URL, and the token ID. Because you can mint more than one token with this instance address you need to specify the token ID. You can use either your terminal to give these parameters as inputs or you can create a JSON file and give that file as a parameter to `concordium-client`. To make it more user-friendly, a JSON file is created in this tutorial. In your project file create a folder with any name you want. In this tutorial it is called “nft-artifacts” and the JSON file is called `nft-params.json`. You can either do it manually or with following commands.

```console
mkdir nft-artifacts
```

```console
cd nft-artifacts
```

```console
touch nft-params.json
```

With a text editor open up that file and place your account address and token ID in the JSON file as shown in the example below.

```console
{
    "owner": {
        "Account": ["3bzmSxeKVgHR4M7pF347WeehXcu43kypgHqhSfDMs9SvcP5zto"]
    },
    "tokens": ["00000111"]
}
```

Then run the command below to invoke the mint function with the given params.

```console
concordium-client contract update <YOUR-CONTRACT-INSTANCE> --entrypoint mint --parameter-json nft-artifacts/nft-params.json --sender <YOUR-ADDRESS> --energy 6000 --grpc-port 20001
```

Minting is successful.

concordium-client contract invoke <YOUR-INDEX> --entrypoint view --grpc-port 20001
```

Your result will be similar to what is shown below where the user is the owner of the token with ID **00000111**.

![](/images/view-fn.png)json
["00000111"]
```

You can query the metadata with the following command.

```console
concordium-client contract invoke <YOUR-INDEX> --entrypoint tokenMetadata --parameter-json nft-artifacts/token-ids.json --grpc-port 20001
```

This returns the metadata URL combined with your tokenID.

Now you can transfer it. One reminder, you should be the owner of it to be able to transfer it, so try not to get confused in this step. The original minter account should be in the **from** key’s value and the receiver will be located in the **to** key’s value. When you specify your account addresses and tokenID to be transferred, run the command below. You are going to invoke the transfer function with given parameters.

```console
concordium-client  contract update <YOUR-INDEX> --entrypoint transfer --parameter-json nft-artifacts/transfer-params.json --sender <YOUR-ADDRESS> --energy 6000 --grpc-ip 127.0.0.1 --grpc-port 20001
```

The transfer is successfully completed.

You have now completed the NFT minting tutorial.
