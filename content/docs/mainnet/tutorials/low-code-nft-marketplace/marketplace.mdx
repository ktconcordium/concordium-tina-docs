To make it quicker and easier to develop and run an NFT marketplace, the Low-Code NFT Minting tool and marketplace have been created. It includes built-in smart contracts, a template user interface, and various functionalities, including the following:

- Connect with Concordium Wallet for Web
- Buy/Sell NFTs with a fixed price
- Mint NFTs with providing metadata
- Mint NFTs without metadata / with Pinata API key + IPFS Integration
- Mint NFT collections with/without metadata (Pinata API key)
- Mint Semi-Fungible tokens by specifying the token amount from a basic user interface
- Set royalties of NFTs
- Set a commission (for the marketplace owner)

Before starting, make sure that you have the following installed:

- Concordium Wallet for Web - [setup instructions](/docs/mainnet/docs/browser-wallet/setup-browser-wallet#setup-browser-wallet)

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) verion 14.17.0 or above. If you already have node.js run ``node -v`` to check the version. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple Node versions installed on a single machine.

- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) - a package manager for JavaScript; replaces the ``npm`` client.

- A code editor of your choice, such as Visual Studio Code.

Once you have the above installed, do the following:

1. Clone the repository with the following command:

    ```console

    git clone https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-dapp-examples/tree/main/low-code-nft-marketplace

    ```
2. Install the repository's dependencies with the following command:

    ```console

    cd Low-Code-NFT-Framework/market-ui && yarn install

    ```
3. Run the application with the following command. It starts the marketplace example dApp automatically in ``localhost:3000`` starting with the example page.

    ```console

    yarn start

    ```
**Initialize the marketplace**

In this step, you will create an instance of the deployed marketplace with the connected wallet address. You can specify the commission and run your own marketplace.

<Callout
  body={<>
You can also build and deploy a new marketplace contract by following these steps.
  </>}
  variant="info"

4. Connect to the application with your Concordium Wallet for Web.

![marketplace web page with wallet popup](/images/mp-connect-wallet.png)
    <Callout
      body={<>
Before continue, make sure that you have some CCDs in your wallet to be able to initialize the Marketplace. Since this is testnet you can ask for testnet CCDs when you set up your account.
      </>}
      variant="info"
    />
5. Click **Create My Marketplace**.

![marketplace web page with create marketplace highlighted](/images/mp-create-mp.png)
6. A form appears that allows you to create a marketplace instance with two options. First, you can either create a marketplace instance from the one which is already deployed by you. Second, you can create your marketplace contract instance from the smart contract deployed by Concordium. Specify the commission and click **Deploy New**. This calls the initialize function of the marketplace contract and that instance will be your account's.

![marketplace web page with deploy new highlighted](/images/mp-deploy-new.png)
7. The Concordium Wallet for Web presents a pop up and asks for your approval. To approve the traansaction click **Sign & submit**.

![marketplace web page with wallet popup shown](/images/mp-new-mp-wallet.png)
When the transaction is finalized, you have your own, empty marketplace. You see the contract instance address in the address bar of the browser or you can check it from your Concordium Wallet for Web as described in the following.

![empty marketplace with contract address highlighted in address bar](/images/mp-new-mp-contract-index.png)
To check the contract instance and find the address in the Concordium Wallet for Web:

8. Click on an account so that you see the account details and transaction log.

![concordium wallet for web showing account details](/images/mp-bw-account-details.png)
![concordium wallet for web showing transaction details](/images/mp-bw-transaction-details.png)
    As you can see there is a contract initialization transaction in the log, and when you click it, the **Events** section tells you that you have initialized smart contract Market-NFT at address 2258,0. In your case this number will be different and you will need it in the next section.

**Configure the application**

The following describes the necessary steps to run your own marketplace that is generated from the deployed marketplace contract.

Now you have to configure your code base accordingly. Go to your project's folder/market-ui and open the **Constants.ts** file in a code editor. Update the ``MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`` with your contract instance address value generated in the previous section. In this file in general you will find all constant files, such as address, schema, and module references. You can find more details about these constant variables in this section.

![constants.ts file open in code editor with address highlighted](/images/mp-configure-index.png)
When you specify the contract instance address value, the template will be interacting with your instance, meaning it will have a clean marketplace like below to remove new instance creation from your marketplace and change the ``CREATE_NEW__MARKETPLACE`` flag to false.

![constants.ts file open in code editor with create new marketplace flag highlighted](/images/mp-configure-mp-flag.png)
You now have your own marketplace with the commission rate you specified.

  docText={<>
Within your custom marketplace you can mint your NFTs. After creating your marketplace, you have an empty NFT Marketplace as shown below. In this section you will learn how to create an NFT using your own marketplace.

Click **MINT** in the top navigation bar. You have two options in this step. First, if you already know an NFT contract instance's address and you are the owner, you can specify it in the **Find** section or click to deploy a new button to create a new instance of an already deployed NFT contract.

![marketplace home page](/images/mp-mint-nft.png)
This opens the Concordium Wallet for Web where you click **Sign & submit** to approve the request. After the transaction is finalized you can check your wallet to find out what your token contract instance address is. It is under the **Transaction Log** section and see the details by clicking it.

![concordium wallet for web showing account details](/images/mp-bw-account-details.png)
![concordium wallet for web showing transaction details](/images/mp-bw-transaction-details.png)
In the image above the you can see in the **Events** section that the CIS2-Multi smart contract instance is initialized at address <2258,0>.

When you have your NFT contract instance, the application redirects you to the storage options. With this template you have two different options while minting an NFT: mint NFTs providing metadata or mint NFTs with Pinata.

You are going to store all digital assets on Interplanetary File System (IPFS) which is the world's leading decentralized storage solution.

  heading="Mint Semi-fungible tokens"
  docText={<>

The process to mint semi-fungible tokens is more or less the same as regular minting; you are expected to provide metadata for your token. Follow the exact instructions with minting, such as clicking the "MINT" button on the top navigation bar.

<Callout
  body={<>
Remember CIS-2 covers all tokens with one standard.
  </>}
  variant="info"

The app asks you either to create your own NFT contract instance or provide the contract instance address that you own. Specify your contract address, such as 2319,0.

![contract lookup screen in marketplace](/images/mint-sft-sc.png)
<Callout
  body={<>
As an example, the metadata providing option is selected. You can mint your tokens with Pinata or any other URL that contains metadata that has CIS-2 standard configuration.
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>
Click **Find**. When prompted to ontinue with Pinata or metadata option, click **SKIP** and then click **ADD USING METADATA URL**. Paste your metadata JSON file URL in the text box and specify a token ID for your token. Specify the **QUANTITY** of your token which is the amount of this semi-fungible token you will be minting.

  docText={<>
With Concordium Low-Code NFT Marketplace you are able to sell your tokens with fixed prices in terms of CCDs! As an owner of a digital asset, you should specify the amount of CCDs that you'd like to sell and the buyer will have to pay that amount + fees. If the commission was set as greater than 0 percent by the marketplace owner then the seller also has to pay a commission.

1. Click **SELL** on the top navigation bar.

2. Specify the token contract instance address. The token smart contract will have all the tokens minted with their owners and other relevant data. After you specify the token contract instance address click **FIND**.

![marketplace with sell page open and fields to enter contract instance address](/images/mp-sell-nft.png)
3. When the Concordium Wallet for Web pop-up prompts you, click **Sign & submit**. It will check if there is an asset on that particular contract, and then you will give permission to the marketplace contract to act on your behalf when someone wants to buy your asset. The tokens will still be owned by your account.

![marketplace with sell page open and wallet popup shown](/images/mp-sell-nft-wallet.png)
4. Enter the token ID to verify that you have some amount of that asset. Click **OK**.

![marketplace with sell page open and verification dialog shown](/images/mp-sell-nft-verify.png)
5. If you have a balance then the **Add Token** window appears. In this screen, you can specify the CCD amount, royalty percentage (creator commission from all secondary sales on this marketplace), and how many of your assets will be put on sale. For example, if you have minted 10000 Semi-Fungible tokens with this ID you might only have 999 be available to sell. Click **ADD**.

![marketplace with sell page open and token details for the sale](/images/mp-sell-nft-details.png)
6. In the Concordium Wallet for Web pop-up click **Sign & submit** to allow the marketplace to sell your assets on your behalf.

![marketplace with sell page open and concordium wallet for web confirmation popup](/images/mp-sell-nft-wallet-confirm.png)
Once finalized, if everything is configured correctly, then you see the digital asset listed in the **Buy** section.
