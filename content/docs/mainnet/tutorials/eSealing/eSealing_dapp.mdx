(esealing-dapp)=


You can explore the [hosted eSealing service](https://esealing.testnet.concordium.com) or
start your own frontend by following the instructions in the README.md file of this
[repository](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-browser-wallet/tree/main/examples/eSealing) to get an overview of the dApp flow.

<Callout
  body={<>
Comprehensive instructions on how to set up the Concordium Wallet for Web, create an account in the Concordium Wallet for Web,
get some testnet CCD and run a local frontend can be found in [setup a wallet](/docs/shared/setup-env#setup-wallet).
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>


The frontend supports the following two flows with the Concordium Wallet for Web (or the Concordium Wallet for Mobile that uses WalletConnect):

- Compute the file hash of a selected file => register its file hash in the smart contract
- Compute the file hash of a selected file => retrieve the timestamp and witness (sealer account) that registered the file hash

<Callout
  body={<>
Select the **registration tab** to register the file hash and the **display tab** to look up the
timestamp and witness (sealer account) of an already registered file.

<Callout
  body={<>
A file hash is an algorithmic way to assign a unique string to a file using a cryptographic hash function (e.g., [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)) based on the file content.
Changing the file's content would result in a completely new file hash. The eSealing smart contract expects a file hash of length 256-bits as an
input parameter because of the used [HashSha2256](https://docs.rs/concordium-std/latest/concordium_std/struct.HashSha2256.html) type.

## Register a file

Select the **Registration tab** to register the file hash as shown below:

## Use Concordium Client

The frontend is connected to a deployed eSealing smart contract on the Concordium testnet
with [this source code](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/examples/eSealing).

You can interact directly with the smart contract using `concordium-client` and your local node
that is running at port 20001 to register a file hash as follows:

```console
$ concordium-client contract update 2481 --entrypoint registerFile --sender <YourAccount> --energy 30000 --parameter-json fileHash.json --grpc-port 20001
```

Create a `fileHash.json` file with a file hash as content similar to:

```json
"14fe0aed941aa0a0be1118d7b7dd70bfca475310c531f1b5a179b336c075db65"
```

![](./images/registerFile.png)console
$ sha256sum ./yourFile.txt
```
:::

You can view the `timestamp` and `witness` (sealer account) of an already timestamped file as follows:

```console
$ concordium-client contract invoke 2481 --entrypoint getFile --parameter-json fileHash.json --grpc-port 20001
```

## What is the cost of using your account to seal a file?

The cost is currently approximately 4-5 cents (Euro) to register a file hash in the smart contract on mainnet.
Displaying the timestamp and witness (sealer_account) of a file hash is free of charge because you don't send a transaction,
you just look up the values from the chain.
