## What is file sealing? What is timestamping?

Seals are used to protect items that should not be tampered with.
You can prove an item's origin and integrity after it has been timestamped
on the blockchain. Timestamping is a blockchain-based verification and
fraud protection process that assures the authenticity of a document.
If you seal and timestamp a file, you can prove that it was in your possession
at the sealing time and the file has not been changed since then.
