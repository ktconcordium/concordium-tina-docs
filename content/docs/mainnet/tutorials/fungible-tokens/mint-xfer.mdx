(mint-xfer-ft)=


Now you are ready to mint your new tokens. Before minting, look at the minting parameters in the JSON file below. You need to specify the owner, then the token data following with its tokenID, metadata location on IPFS with the URL that you got when you uploaded the metadata file, hash value of it, amount to be minted, and maximum supply number. In this case, it uses tokenID `01`, and mint `110` tokens initially with a maximum supply of 1000.

```JSON
{
    "owner": {
        "Account": [
            "3AiAikC2v4H3Rv4L58oHvdX5N8LJoarsQwN3G7oNS7BoFsmt7N"
        ]
    },
    "tokens": [
        [
            "01",
            [
                {
                    "url": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZBrF6HuoN12HyAznyk7gwFpnefooDbfxq3JeKTWToL1W",
                    "hash": "c00a140ea66af09c343083c0e7ccc77d5e0670d90014569798801bffad637d15"
                },
                {
                    "amount": "110",
                    "max_supply": "1000"
                }
            ]
        ]
    ]
}
```

Run the command below to call the contract `mint()` function. Remember that this is using the Concordium testnet node; if you are using your own node your command needs to be changed.

```console
concordium-client contract update <YOUR-CONTRACT-INSTANCE> --entrypoint mint --parameter-json ../nft-artifacts/mint-params.json --sender <YOUR-ACCOUNT> --energy 6000 --grpc-port 20000 --grpc-ip grpc.testnet.concordium.com --secure
```

Now you have successfully minted your fungible tokens.

```

Unsurprisingly, you are not allowed to mint and it throws a custom error which was created by you in the `MaxSupplyReached` in your error enum.

Mint 500 more by adjusting the JSON file accordingly.

## Transfer tokens

Now you will test transferring some tokens to another account and checking the balances and the max/circulating supplies. Create a JSON file like the one below to set the transfer parameters. Transfer **11** tokens with the ID **01** to an account.

```JSON
[
    {
        "token_id": "01",
        "amount": "11",
        "from": {
            "Account": [
                "3AiAikC2v4H3Rv4L58oHvdX5N8LJoarsQwN3G7oNS7BoFsmt7N"
            ]
        },
        "to": {
            "Account": [
                "4W59joBQavXqbyiKbPgBS7teZHDtEXsqx2BFUvPo2AzY3yPzeH"
            ]
        },
        "data": ""
    }
]
```

Run the command below to invoke the transfer. Remember that this is using the Concordium testnet node; if you are using your own node your command needs to be changed.

```console
concordium-client contract update <YOUR-INDEX> --entrypoint transfer --parameter-json ../token-artifacts/transfer.json --sender <YOUR-ACCOUNT> --energy 6000 --grpc-port 20000 --grpc-ip grpc.testnet.concordium.com --secure
```

Check the state one more time to see that the transfer worked as expected.

Create a JSON file for getting burn params like the one below. You need the token ID and the amount to be burned.

```JSON
{
    "token_id": "01",
    "amount": "200"
}
```

Burn 200 tokens from your first account. To do that, run the command below to call the `burn()` function.

```console
concordium-client contract update <YOUR-INDEX> --entrypoint burn --parameter-json ../token-artifacts/burn.json --sender <YOUR-ACCOUNT> --energy 6000 --grpc-port 20000 --grpc-ip grpc.testnet.concordium.com --secure
```
