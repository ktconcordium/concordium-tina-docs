This topic describes how you create and export a file with credentials. For information about adding more credentials to an account, see [Add credentials to an account](#multi-credentials).

## Create and export a file with credentials

1. First, you need the address of the account your credentials will be added to. If you have the account in you address book, you can copy it from there. Otherwise, you'll have to ask the address creator to send you a copy of the account address.
2. Go to **Multi Signature Transactions** in the Desktop Wallet.
3. Select **Export a key**, and then select **Account credentials**.
4. Select the identity you want to add to the account. The identity must have been created on the LEDGER device that's connected to the computer. Otherwise, you'll see an error message. Select **Continue**.
5. Paste the address of the account that you want to add credentials to, and then give the account a name. This is the name that will be shown in your list of accounts.
6. Select **Reveal attributes** if you want any attributes to be public on the blockchain. Concordium recommends that you don't reveal any attributes.
7. Select **Continue**.
8. In the Desktop Wallet there's a message saying **Waiting for device. Please connect your Ledger**. Connect the LEDGER device to your computer and enter your PIN on the LEDGER device.
9. On the LEDGER device press both buttons to open the Concordium application. There's a message saying **Concordium is ready**.
10. In the Desktop Wallet, there's a message saying **Ledger device is ready**. Select **Submit**.
11. Press both buttons to confirm the following on the LEDGER device:
    * Create credential (each credential is assigned a number): Press the right button and then both buttons to confirm **Accept**.
    * Public key: Press both buttons to accept.
12. Verify that the public key on the LEDGER device corresponds to the public key in the Desktop Wallet. Press both buttons, and then use the right button to navigate through the key.
13. Press both buttons to confirm, and then in the Desktop Wallet, select **Continue**.
14. The LEDGER device says **Review details**. Press both buttons, and then press the right button to navigate through the public key and verify that it corresponds to the information in the Desktop Wallet. Press both buttons to confirm.
15. Verify that the account address on the LEDGER device corresponds to the account address in the Desktop Wallet.
16. The LEDGER device says **Sign details**. Press both buttons to sign the transaction. In the Desktop Wallet, the account credential summary is displayed.
17. Select **Export** and navigate to the place on your computer where you want to save the file with the credentials. Make sure that you save the file with the extension .json.
18. Click on the identicon to copy it. Send the .json file and the copy of the identicon through secure channels to the current owner of the account.
19. Select **Finish**.

The creator of the account now has to import the file and add the credentials to the account. See [Add credentials to an account](#multi-credentials).
