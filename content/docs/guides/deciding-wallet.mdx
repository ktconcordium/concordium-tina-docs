## Why you need a wallet

You need a Concordium wallet to interact with the Concordium blockchain and manage your CCD tokens. Here are the currently available wallets:

* Desktop Wallet: Offers the highest security but requires a LEDGER device.
* Browser Wallet: Accessible from any device with a web browser supporting Chrome extensions. Ideal for standard transactions, great for developers and dApp users.
* CryptoX: The latest mobile wallet, user-friendly with both seed phrase and file-based recovery and dApp connectivity.

The wallets are developed by Concordium Software and can only be used to hold CCD,
the native token of the Concordium blockchain, and CIS-2 tokens.
You can't use these wallets for any other crypto currencies.

## Choosing the Right Wallet

Consider these factors when choosing a wallet:

* Security: Desktop Wallet offers the most security with its LEDGER device support.
* Accessibility: Browser Wallet and CryptoX are more accessible for everyday use.
* Device: Choose a wallet compatible with your device (computer or mobile).
* Features: CryptoX offers the most features, including seed phrase or key file recovery and dApp connectivity.

## Portability limits between wallets

* Identities and accounts cannot be directly transferred between Desktop Wallet and other wallets.
* CryptoX can import accounts from other Concordium wallets via seed phrase of backup file.
* You can always send CCD tokens between any wallets.

## Wallet Backups

* Desktop Wallet: Requires exporting data and keeping the LEDGER recovery phrase safe.
* Browser Wallet and CryptoX: Securely store the seed phrase generated during setup.

## What are the requirements for each wallet?

* Desktop Wallet: A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux, and a LEDGER NANO S PLUS.
* Browser Wallet: A device running one of the supported Chromium internet browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge) with the Browser Wallet extension installed.
* CryptoX: An iPhone running iOS 15 or later or an Android phone running Android 8 or later.
