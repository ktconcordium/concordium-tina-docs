Congrats! If you are started with Mid-Level tutorials that means you have completed the first section and its assignment. Don't forget to [claim your NFT Badge](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ks_oWIxbRoW6NGHHjwOGfaO4pVvZAD92me0ChbvzDZc/edit).

In the second section, we assume you know Concordium better: you can implement, deploy and interact with your contract and get the basics well. So in this section, the difficulty of the tutorials will be slightly higher but still doable by a great talent like you!

When you have completed the tutorials, you can attempt [the mid-level assignment](/docs/academy/assignment-2/dapp-using-walletconnect#dapp-using-walletconnect) to obtain your next NFT badge!
