title: "Mint fractionalized NFTs"

(mint-fractionalized-nft)=


You have deployed fractionalizer and are ready to mint some NFTs as a fraction of another one. To do that follow these steps:

- Mint a CIS-2 NFT
- Transfer NFT to the fractionalizer contract and lock it.
- Mint fractions
- Check state
- Transfer some
- Burn all of them
- Check the state

## Mint a regular NFT (to be collateralized)

Remember that your fractionalization logic starts with collateralizing the CIS-2 NFT. In order to mint a CIS-2 NFT you can follow the [Mint a Semi-fungible token tutorial](/docs/mainnet/tutorials/sft-minting/index#sft-index). As previously mentioned in this tutorial, you will use cis2-multi smart contract for minting our token and you can find the full code here. The screenshot below shows only the `mint()` function. You can find build/deploy processes in the tutorial.

![](/images/mid-fractnft-mint1.png)console
concordium-client contract invoke <YOUR-TOKEN-CONTRACT-INDEX>--entrypoint view --schema ../cis2-multi/dist/schema.bin --grpc-port 20000 --grpc-ip node.testnet.concordium.com
```

![](/images/mid-fractnft-mint2.png)console
[
{
"token_id": "<YOUR-TOKEN-ID>",
"amount": "<TOKEN-AMOUNT-TO-LOCK>",
"from": {
"Account": [
    "<YOUR-ACCOUNT>"
]
},
"to": {
"Contract": [
    {
    "index": <YOUR-FRACTIONALIZER-CONTRACT-INDEX>,
    "subindex": 0
    },
    "onReceivingCIS2"
]
},
"data": ""
}
]
```

Don't get confused in this part. You need to use the **token’s schema** to change **its state**. You want to keep both schemas in the same project folder for the sake of order. That's why you created a section for the **cis2-multi** contract's schema file, so you can either copy the **schema** file from cis2-multi to your fractionalizer directory´, or you can call it from that file using the JSON above. This tutorial does it the first way, by creating a file and copying/pasting the schema from cis2-multi.

Run the command below to transfer the token to the fractionalizer.

```console
concordium-client contract update <YOUR-TOKEN-CONTRACT-INSTANCE> --entrypoint transfer --parameter-json cis2-fractionalizer/cis2-multi-transfer.json --schema multi/dist/schema.bin --sender <YOUR-ADDRESS> --energy 6000 --grpc-port 20000 --grpc-ip node.testnet.concordium.com
```

```

Super cool! As you can see, the fractionalizer contract has one token and your account has the rest.

Now, check the fractionalizer’s state.

![](/images/mid-fractnft-mint5.png)console
{
"owner": {
"Account": ["<YOUR-ACCOUNT>"]
},
"tokens": [
[
"<YOUR-TOKEN-ID>",
{
    "metadata": {
    "url": "<METADATA-URL>",
    "hash": "<HASH>"
    },
    "amount": "<FRACTION-AMOUNT>",
    "contract": { "index": <YOUR-TOKEN-CONTRACT-INDEX>, "subindex": 0 },
    "token_id": "<YOUR-TOKEN-ID-COLLATERAL>"
}
]
]
}
```

Then run the following command to mint the fractions.

```console
concordium-client contract update <YOUR-CONTRACT-INSTANCE> --entrypoint mint --parameter-json ../sample-artifacts/cis2-fractionalizer/mint.json --schema ../cis2-fractionalizer/schema.bin --sender $ACCOUNT --energy 6000 --grpc-port 20000 --grpc-ip node.testnet.concordium.com
```

![](/images/mid-fractnft-mint6.png)console
concordium-client contract invoke <YOUR-FRACTIONALIZER-CONTRACT-INDEX> --entrypoint view --schema dist/schema.bin  --grpc-port 20000 --grpc-ip node.testnet.concordium.com
```

Congrats! You have now locked an NFT and created 1000 fractions that represent the token. New fractions are CIS-2 tokens, and you can transfer them or sell them on a marketplace. Anything that can apply to a CIS-2 token is also available for these fractions.
