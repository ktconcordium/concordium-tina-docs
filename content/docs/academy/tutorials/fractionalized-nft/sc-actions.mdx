So far so good! You have implemented your smart contract and now you are ready to build, deploy, and create an instance of it.

## Build smart contract

First, build the smart contract into Wasm format. Use the following command to do it. You can extract the **schema** and Wasm-compiled file into a new folder called *dist* as shown in this example.

```console
cargo concordium build --out dist/module.wasm.v1 --schema-out dist/schema.bin
```

![](/../images/mid-fractnft-scactions1.png)console
concordium-client module deploy dist/module.wasm.v1 --sender <YOUR-ADDRESS> --name CIS2-Fractionalizer --grpc-port 20000 --grpc-ip node.testnet.concordium.com
```

![](/../images/mid-fractnft-scactions2.png)console
concordium-client contract init <YOUR-MODULE-HASH> --sender <YOUR-ADDRESS> --energy 30000 --contract CIS2-Fractionalizer --grpc-port 20000 --grpc-ip node.testnet.concordium.com
```

Excellent. Now you can continue to the [following section](/docs/academy/tutorials/fractionalized-nft/mint#mint-fractionalized-nft).
