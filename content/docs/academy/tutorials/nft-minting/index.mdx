title: "NFT minting tutorial with Rust-SDK"
---

(nft-mining-w-rust-sdk-index)=


In this tutorial you will interact with a CIS-2 token contract for minting an NFT using the [Concordium Rust-SDK](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-sdk). You will deploy and initialize the contract using the SDK and similarly invoke functions like `mint()`, `transfer()`, and `tokenMetadata()` using it. Since this is an SDK-oriented tutorial, there will not be any specific explanation about smart contract development. You can find many other examples that show how you can interact with Concordium using the Rust-SDK in [this example GitHub repository](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-sdk/tree/main/examples). You will use the [Concordium Smart Contracts VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Concordium.concordium-smart-contracts) to create your template contract.
