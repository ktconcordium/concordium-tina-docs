In this last section, you will learn how to run the dApp to mint an NFT.

## Verifier backend

First you need to run the verifier backend. Your dApp will be communicating with it to get the statement, challenge and post the proof and get the signature back. It expects parameters from the terminal but you are free to use all of them from a JSON file. We will use a mixture by giving the keys (verify and sign) as a parameter from the terminal and the statement from a JSON. In order to create a custom statement, you can check read about [how to create proofs](/docs/mainnet/docs/network/guides/create-proofs#create-proofs). For this tutorial scenario, you will use age proofs to be able to verify if a person is older than 18 or not, but you can also check if the person is from a certain country or not.

```console
[
    {
        "type": "AttributeInRange",
        "attributeTag": "dob",
        "lower": "19000327",
        "upper": "20050327"
    }
]
```

When you have the statement JSON file, run the application inside of your executable path. If you are using your own node change the node IP to localhost; if you are using the testnet node keep it as below.

```console
./<Executable-Name> --node http://node.testnet.concordium.com --port 8100 --log-level info --verify-key <YOUR-VERIFY-KEY> --sign-key <YOUR-SIGN-KEY> --statement "$(<PATH-TO-YOUR-STATEMENT/statement.json)"
```

yarn start
```

You will create a new instance of the cis2-multi contract and try to mint an NFT with another account. Click **DEPLOY NEW** to create a new instance. As you notice, it sends the `verify_key` as an initiation parameter. The contract index is 4168,0.

If everything goes well, you have a signature similar to the one below.

When the transaction is finalized, you will have an alert notifying that minting is successful!
